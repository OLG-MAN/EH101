### Intercepting Web Requests

```
# Burp

# In Burp, we can navigate to the Proxy tab, and request interception should be on by default. 
# If we want to turn request interception on or off, we may go to the Intercept sub-tab and click on Intercept is on/off button to do so.

# Once we turn request interception on, we can start up the pre-configured browser and then visit our target website 
# after spawning it from the exercise at the end of this section. 
# Then, once we go back to Burp, we will see the intercepted request awaiting our action, 
# and we can click on forward to forward the request.

# ZAP 

# In ZAP, interception is off by default, as shown by the green button on the top bar 
# (green indicates that requests can pass and not be intercepted). 
# We can click on this button to turn the Request Interception on or off, 
# or we can use the shortcut [CTRL+B] to toggle it on or off.

# ZAP also has a powerful feature called Heads Up Display (HUD), 
# which allows us to control most of the main ZAP features from right within the pre-configured browser. 
# We can enable the HUD by clicking its button at the end of the top menu bar.

```

```
# Manipulating Intercepted Requests

# Once we intercept the request, it will remain hanging until we forward it, as we did above. 
# We can examine the request, manipulate it to make any changes we want, and then send it to its destination. 
# This helps us better understand what information a particular web application is sending in its web requests 
# and how it may respond to any changes we make in that request.

# There are numerous applications for this in Web Penetration Testing, such as testing for:

- SQL injections
- Command injections
- Upload bypass
- Authentication bypass
- XSS
- XXE
- Error handling
- Deserialization
```

```
# With the power of intercepting and manipulating HTTP requests, we can try using other characters to "break" the application
#  ("breaking" the request/response flow by manipulating the target parameter, not damaging the target web application). 
# If the web application does not verify and validate the HTTP requests on the back-end, 
# we may be able to manipulate it and exploit it.

# So, let us change the ip parameter's value from 1 to ;ls; and see how the web application handles our input.
# Once we click continue/forward, we will see that the response changed from the default ping output to the ls output, 
# meaning that we successfully manipulated the request to inject our command.

# This demonstrates a basic example of how request interception and manipulation can help with testing web applications 
# for various vulnerabilities, which is considered an essential tool to be able to test different web applications effectively.
```

### Task solution
```
# ZAP
# Go to in built-in browser, run web app from lab, input "1" to form and submit.
# In intercepted request change value ip=1 to ip=;cat flag.txt; and click play buttons to proceed processing.
# flag will output both in ZAP output, and in built-in browser. (Processing is not quickly can be 5-7 sec)


# Burp
# Go to proxy, turn on interception, start web app, paste "1" to form and submit.
# in Burp request output modify ip=1 same as in ZAP option. 
# Click forward, wait until flag will appear in built-in web browser (same 5-7 sec)
```

### Intercepting Responses

```
# In Burp, we can enable response interception by going to (Proxy>Options) 
# and enabling Intercept Response under Intercept Server Responses.

# Example:
# After that, we can enable request interception once more and refresh the page with [CTRL+SHIFT+R] 
# in our browser (to force a full refresh). 
# When we go back to Burp, we should see the intercepted request, and we can click on forward. 
# Once we forward the request, we'll see our intercepted response.

# Next we can try to change the type="number" to type="text", which should enable us to write any value we want. 
# We will also change the maxlength="3" to maxlength="100" so we can enter longer input.
# Now, once we click on forward again, we can go back to Firefox to examine the edited response.
```

```
# ZAP

# Let's try to see how we can do the same with ZAP. As we saw in the previous section, 
# when our requests are intercepted by ZAP, we can click on Step, 
# and it will send the request and automatically intercept the response.

# Once we make the same changes we previously did and click on Continue, 
# we will see that we can also use any input value.
```

### Automatic Modification

```
# We may want to apply certain modifications to all outgoing HTTP requests or all incoming HTTP responses in certain situations. 
# In these cases, we can utilize automatic modifications based on rules we set, so the web proxy tools will automatically apply them.
```

### Automatic Request Modification

```
# Burp
# Let us start with an example of automatic request modification. We can choose to match any text within our requests, 
# either in the request header or request body, and then replace them with different text. 
# For the sake of demonstration, let's replace our User-Agent with HackTheBox Agent 1.0, 
# which may be handy in cases where we may be dealing with filters that block certain User-Agents.

# We can go to (Proxy>Options>Match and Replace) and click on Add in Burp.:

- Type: Request header                  # Since the change we want to make will be in the request header and not in its body.
- Match: ^User-Agent.*$                 # The regex pattern that matches the entire line with User-Agent in it.
- Replace: User-Agent: HTB Agent 1.0 	# This is the value that will replace the line we matched above.
- Regex match: True                     # We don't know the exact User-Agent string we want to replace, 
                                        # so we'll use regex to match any value that matches the pattern we specified above.

# Once we enter the above options and click Ok, our new Match and Replace option will be added 
# and enabled and will start automatically replacing the User-Agent header in our requests with our new User-Agent.
```

```
# ZAP Replacer

# ZAP has a similar feature called Replacer, which we can access by pressing [CTRL+R] 
# or clicking on Replacer in ZAP's options menu. 
# It is fairly similar to what we did above, so we can click on Add and add the same options we user earlier:

- Description: HTB User-Agent.
- Match Type: Request Header (will add if not present).
- Match String: User-Agent. We can select the header we want from the drop-down menu, and ZAP will replace its value.
- Replacement String: HackTheBox Agent 1.0.
- Enable: True.

# ZAP also has the Request Header String that we can use with a Regex pattern. 
# Try using this option with the same values we used for Burp to see how it works.

# ZAP also provides the option to set the Initiators,they enable us to select where our Replacer option will be applied.
# We will keep the default option of Apply to all HTTP(S) messages to apply everywhere.
```

### Automatic Response Modification

```
# The same concept can be used with HTTP responses as well. 

# Let us go back to (Proxy>Options>Match and Replace) in Burp to add another rule. 
# This time we will use the type of Response body since the change we want 
# to make exists in the response's body and not in its headers. 
# In this case, we do not have to use regex as we know the exact string we want to replace, 
# though it is possible to use regex to do the same thing if we prefer.

- Type: Response body.
- Match: type="number".
- Replace: type="text".
- Regex match: False.

# Try adding another rule to change maxlength="3" to maxlength="100".

# Now, once we refresh the page with [CTRL+SHIFT+R], we'll see that we can add any input to the input field, 
# and this should persist between page refreshes as well.(?)

# We can now click on Ping, and our command injection should work without intercepting and modifying the request.
```

```
# The same rules with ZAP Replacer. 

# Change input type to text:
- Match Type: Response Body String.
- Match Regex: False.
- Match String: type="number".
- Replacement String: type="text".
- Enable: True.

# Change max length to 100:
- Match Type: Response Body String.
- Match Regex: False.
- Match String: maxlength="3".
- Replacement String: maxlength="100".
- Enable: True. 
```
