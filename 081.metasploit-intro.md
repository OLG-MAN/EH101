### Metasploit Pro

```
# Metasploit as a product is split into two versions. 
# The Metasploit Pro version is different from the Metasploit Framework one with some additional features:

- Task Chains
- Social Engineering
- Vulnerability Validations
- GUI
- Quick Start Wizards
- Nexpose Integration
```

### Metasploit Framework Console

```
# The msfconsole is probably the most popular interface to the Metasploit Framework (MSF). 
# It provides an "all-in-one" centralized console and allows you efficient access to virtually all options available in the MSF. 
# Msfconsole may seem intimidating at first, but once you learn the syntax of the commands, 
# you will learn to appreciate the power of utilizing this interface.

# The features that msfconsole generally brings are the following:

- It is the only supported way to access most of the features within Metasploit
- Provides a console-based interface to the Framework
- Contains the most features and is the most stable MSF interface
- Full readline support, tabbing, and command completion
- Execution of external commands in msfconsole

# Both products mentioned above come with an extensive database of available modules to use in our assessments.
```

### Understanding the Architecture

```
# To fully operate whatever tool we are using, we must first look under its hood. 
# It is good practice, and it can offer us better insight into what will be going on during our security assessments when that tool comes into play. 

# By default, all the base files related to Metasploit Framework can be found under /usr/share/metasploit-framework in our ParrotOS Security distro.

# Data, Documentation, Lib
# These are the base files for the Framework. 
# The Data and Lib are the functioning parts of the msfconsole interface, 
# while the Documentation folder contains all the technical details about the project.

# Modules
# The Modules detailed above are split into separate categories in this folder. We will go into detail about these in the next sections. They are contained in # the following folders:
ls /usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules                    # check modules folder
output:
auxiliary  encoders  evasion  exploits  nops  payloads  post

# Plugins
# Plugins offer the pentester more flexibility when using the msfconsole since they can easily be manually or automatically loaded 
# as needed to provide extra functionality and automation during our assessment.
ls /usr/share/metasploit-framework/plugins/                   # check plugins folder
output:
aggregator.rb      ips_filter.rb  openvas.rb           sounds.rb
alias.rb           komand.rb      pcap_log.rb          sqlmap.rb
auto_add_route.rb  lab.rb         request.rb           thread.rb

# Scripts
# Meterpreter functionality and other useful scripts:
ls /usr/share/metasploit-framework/scripts/                   # check scripts etc. folder
output: 
meterpreter  ps  resource  shell

# Tools
# Command-line utilities that can be called directly from the msfconsole menu.
ls /usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/
output:
context  docs     hardware  modules   payloads
dev      exploit  memdump   password  recon
```
