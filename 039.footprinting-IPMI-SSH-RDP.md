### IPMI ###
```
# Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) is a set of standardized specifications 
# for hardware-based host management systems used for system management and monitoring. 
# It acts as an autonomous subsystem and works independently of the host's BIOS, CPU, firmware, and underlying operating system.
# IPMI provides sysadmins with the ability to manage and monitor systems even if they are powered off or in an unresponsive state.
# It operates using a direct network connection to the system's hardware and does not require access to the operating system via a login shell. 
# IPMI can also be used for remote upgrades to systems without requiring physical access to the target host.

# IPMI is typically used in three ways:
- Before the OS has booted to modify BIOS settings
- When the host is fully powered down
- Access to a host after a system failure

# To function, IPMI requires the following components:
- Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - A micro-controller and essential component of an IPMI
- Intelligent Chassis Management Bus (ICMB) - An interface that permits communication from one chassis to another
- Intelligent Platform Management Bus (IPMB) - extends the BMC
- IPMI Memory - stores things such as the system event log, repository store data, and more
- Communications Interfaces - local system interfaces, serial and LAN interfaces, ICMB and PCI Management Bus
```

### Footprinting the Service
```
# By default IPMI port is 623 (UDP)
# Systems that use the IPMI protocol are called Baseboard Management Controllers (BMCs)
# BMCs are built into many motherboards but can also be added to a system as a PCI card.
# If we can access a BMC during an assessment, we would gain full access to the host motherboard 
# and be able to monitor, reboot, power off, or even reinstall the host operating system.
# Gaining access to a BMC is nearly equivalent to physical access to a system.

### Dangerous Settings
```
# If default credentials do not work to access a BMC, we can turn to a [flaw](http://fish2.com/ipmi/remote-pw-cracking.html) in the RAKP protocol in IPMI 2.0.
# During the authentication process, the server sends a salted SHA1 or MD5 hash of the user's password to the client before authentication takes place. 
# This can be leveraged to obtain the password hash for ANY valid user account on the BMC. 
# These password hashes can then be cracked offline using a dictionary attack using Hashcat mode 7300. 
# In the event of an HP iLO using a factory default password, we can use this Hashcat mask attack command:
`hashcat -m 7300 ipmi.txt -a 3 ?1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1 -1 ?d?u` 
# which tries all combinations of upper case letters and numbers for an eight-character password.


# To retrieve IPMI hashes, we can use the Metasploit IPMI 2.0 RAKP Remote SHA1 Password Hash Retrieval module.

### SSH ###
```
# Secure Shell (SSH) enables two computers to establish an encrypted and direct connection within a possibly insecure network on the standard port TCP 22.
# An advantage of SSH is that the protocol runs on all common operating systems. 
# Since it is originally a Unix application, it is also implemented natively on all Linux distributions and MacOS. 
# SSH can also be used on Windows, provided we install an appropriate program. 
# Accordingly, there are two competing protocols: SSH-1 and SSH-2.
# SSH-2, also known as SSH version 2, is a more advanced protocol than SSH version 1 in encryption, speed, stability, and security. 
# For example, SSH-1 is vulnerable to MITM attacks, whereas SSH-2 is not.

# In total, OpenSSH has six different authentication methods:
- Password authentication
- Public-key authentication
- Host-based authentication
- Keyboard authentication
- Challenge-response authentication
- GSSAPI authentication
```

### Default Configuration
```
# The sshd_config file, responsible for the OpenSSH server, has only a few of the settings configured by default. 
# However, the default configuration includes X11 forwarding, which contained a command injection vulnerability in version 7.2p1 of OpenSSH in 2016.
# Nevertheless, we do not need a GUI to manage our servers.
sshd_config:
cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config  | grep -v "#" | sed -r '/^\s*$/d'
output:
Include /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*.conf
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
UsePAM yes
X11Forwarding yes
PrintMotd no
AcceptEnv LANG LC_*
Subsystem       sftp    /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server
```

### Dangerous Settings
```
Setting	                          Description
PasswordAuthentication yes	      Allows password-based authentication.
PermitEmptyPasswords yes	        Allows the use of empty passwords.
PermitRootLogin yes	              Allows to log in as the root user.
Protocol 1	                      Uses an outdated version of encryption.
X11Forwarding yes                	Allows X11 forwarding for GUI applications.
AllowTcpForwarding yes	          Allows forwarding of TCP ports.
PermitTunnel	                    Allows tunneling.
DebianBanner yes	                Displays a specific banner when logging in.

### Rsync
```
# Rsync is a fast and efficient tool for locally and remotely copying files. 
# It can be used to copy files locally on a given machine and to/from remote hosts.
# Tool algorithm reduces the amount of data transmitted over the network when a version of the file already exists on the destination host.
# It is often used for backups and mirroring. 
# This [guide](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/873-pentesting-rsync) covers some of the ways Rsync can be abused.

### R-Services
```
# R-Services are a suite of services hosted to enable remote access or issue commands between Unix hosts over TCP/IP.
# Initially developed by the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) at the University of California, Berkeley.
# r-services were the de facto standard for remote access between Unix operating systems until they were replaced by the Secure Shell (SSH) protocols 
# and commands due to inherent security flaws built into them. 
# Much like telnet, r-services transmit information from client to server(and vice versa.) over the network in an unencrypted format, 
# making it possible for attackers to intercept network traffic (passwords, login information, etc.) by performing man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

# R-services span across the ports `512`, `513`, and `514` and are only accessible through a suite of programs known as r-commands.
# The R-commands suite consists of the following programs:

rcp         remote copy
rexec       remote execution
rlogin      remote login
rsh         remote shell
rstat
ruptime
rwho        remote who

# The table below will provide a quick overview of the most frequently abused commands.
Command	   Service Daemon	   Port	   Transport Protocol	   Description
rcp	       rshd	             514	   TCP	                 Copy a file or directory bidirectionally from the local system to the remote system (or vice versa) or from one remote system to another. It works like the cp command on Linux but provides no warning to the user for overwriting existing files on a system.

rsh	       rshd	             514	   TCP	                 Opens a shell on a remote machine without a login procedure. Relies upon the trusted entries in the /etc/hosts.equiv and .rhosts files for validation.

rexec	     rexecd	           512	   TCP	                 Enables a user to run shell commands on a remote machine. Requires authentication through the use of a username and password through an unencrypted network socket. Authentication is overridden by the trusted entries in the /etc/hosts.equiv and .rhosts files.

rlogin	   rlogind	         513	   TCP	                 Enables a user to log in to a remote host over the network. It works similarly to telnet but can only connect to Unix-like hosts. Authentication is overridden by the trusted entries in the /etc/hosts.equiv and .rhosts files.


# The /etc/hosts.equiv file contains a list of trusted hosts and is used to grant access to other systems on the network. 
cat /etc/hosts.equiv
output:
# <hostname> <local username>
pwnbox cry0l1t3


sudo nmap -sV -p 512,513,514 10.0.17.2      # Scanning for R-Services
```

### Access Control & Trusted Relationships
```
# R-services rely on trusted information sent from the remote client to the host machine they are attempting to authenticate to.
# By default, these services utilize Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) for user authentication onto a remote system; 
# however, they also bypass this authentication through the use of the /etc/hosts.equiv and .rhosts files on the system.
# The hosts.equiv and .rhosts files contain a list of hosts (IPs or Hostnames) 
# and users that are trusted by the local host when a connection attempt is made using r-commands.

# The hosts.equiv file is recognized as the global configuration regarding all users on a system, whereas .rhosts provides a per-user configuration.
Sample .rhosts File:
cat .rhosts

### RDP ###
```
# The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a protocol developed by Microsoft for remote access to a computer running the Windows operating system.
# This protocol allows display and control commands to be transmitted via the GUI encrypted over IP networks. 
# RDP works at the application layer in the TCP/IP reference model, typically utilizing TCP port 3389 as the transport protocol.
# However, the connectionless UDP protocol can use port 3389 also for remote administration.
# The remote computer needs the public IP address to reach the server. (or NAT resolve issue)
# RDP can be activated using the Server Manager and comes with the default setting to 
# allow connections to the service only to hosts with Network level authentication (NLA).
