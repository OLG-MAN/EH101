### SMNP
```
# Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) was created to monitor network devices. 
# In addition, this protocol can also be used to handle configuration tasks and change settings remotely.
# SNMP-enabled hardware includes routers, switches, servers, IoT devices etc.
# The current version is SNMPv3
# By default operate on port 161 and 162 (trap)


# MIB    Management Information Base
# OID    Object Identifier  
# Versions of SNMP
# SNMPv1 (no auth; no encryption) 
# SNMPv2 (no auth; no encryption) 
# SNMPv3 (auth; encryption) 

```

### Default Configuration
```
# Example of configs:
cat /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf | grep -v "#" | sed -r '/^\s*$/d'

### Dangerous Settings
```
rwuser noauth	                                   # Provides access to the full OID tree without authentication.
rwcommunity <community string> <IPv4 address>	   # Provides access to the full OID tree regardless of where the requests were sent from.
rwcommunity6 <community string> <IPv6 address>	   # Same access as with rwcommunity with the difference of using IPv6.
```

### Footprinting the Service
```
# Using snmpwalk, onesixtyone, and braa
snmpwalk -v2c -c public 10.129.14.128              # Grab OID's info with snmpwalk on target host-device

sudo apt install onesixtyone -y
onesixtyone -c /opt/useful/SecLists/Discovery/SNMP/snmp.txt 10.129.14.128      # Grab info with onesixtyone and snmp brute-force list

sudo apt install braa
braa <community string>@<IP>:.1.3.6.*      # Syntax
braa public@10.129.14.128:.1.3.6.*         # Grab OID's info
