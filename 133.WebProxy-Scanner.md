### Burp Scanner

```
# An essential feature of web proxy tools is their web scanners. 
# Burp Suite comes with Burp Scanner, a powerful scanner for various types of web vulnerabilities, 
# using a Crawler for building the website structure, and Scanner for passive and active scanning.

# Burp Scanner is a Pro-Only feature, and it is not available in the free Community version of Burp Suite.
...
```

### Target Scope

```
# To start a scan in Burp Suite, we have the following options:

- Start scan on a specific request from Proxy History
- Start a new scan on a set of targets
- Start a scan on items in-scope

# Next, ta add an item (full site by address, or subfolders) to our scope, we can right-click on it and select Add to scope.
```

### Crawler

```
# Once we have our scope ready, we can go to the Dashboard tab and click on New Scan to configure our scan, 
# which would be automatically populated with our in-scope items.

# We see that Burp gives us two scanning options: Crawl and Audit and Crawl. 
# A Web Crawler navigates a website by accessing any links found in its pages, accessing any forms, 
# and examining any requests it makes to build a comprehensive map of the website. 

# In the end, Burp Scanner presents us with a map of the target, showing all publicly accessible data in a single place. 
```

### Passive Scanner

```
# Now that the site map is fully built, we may select to scan this target for potential vulnerabilities. 
# When we choose the Crawl and Audit option in the New Scan dialog, Burp will perform two types of scans: 
# A Passive Vulnerability Scan and an Active Vulnerability Scan.
```

### Active Scanner

```
We finally reach the most powerful part of Burp Scanner, which is its Active Vulnerability Scanner. An active scan runs a more comprehensive scan than a Passive Scan, as follows:

- It starts by running a Crawl and a web fuzzer (like dirbuster/ffuf) to identify all possible pages
- It runs a Passive Scan on all identified pages
- It checks each of the identified vulnerabilities from the Passive Scan and sends requests to verify them
- It performs a JavaScript analysis to identify further potential vulnerabilities
- It fuzzes various identified insertion points and parameters to look for common vulnerabilities like:
  XSS, Command Injection, SQL Injection, and other common web vulnerabilities
```

### Reporting

```
# Finally, once all of our scans are completed, and all potential issues have been identified, 
# we can go to (Target>Site map), right-click on our target, and select (Issue>Report issues for this host). 
# We will get prompted to select the export type for the report and what information we would like to include in the report. 
```


### ZAP Scanner

```
# ZAP also comes bundled with a Web Scanner similar to Burp Scanner. 
# ZAP Scanner is capable of building site maps using ZAP Spider and performing both passive 
# and active scans to look for various types of vulnerabilities.
```

### Spider

```
# Let's start with ZAP Spider, which is similar to the Crawler feature in Burp. 
# To start a Spider scan on any website, we can locate a request from our History tab 
# and select (Attack>Spider) from the right-click menu. 

```

### Task solution

```
# 94.237.59.180:46123

# Run ZAP Scanner on the target above to identify directories and potential vulnerabilities. 
# Once you find the high-level vulnerability, try to use it to read the flag at '/flag.txt' 

# Tools -> Spider -> paste address -> Start build site map with files, subfolders etc.
# After spider done, right click on all aiste address and click Active scan.

# Wait till scan complete, go to vulnerability "Remote command OS injection"
# Open descrition to check info, next open in a "Request Editor"
# There you can play with a diff commands, to list folders, cat files
# Default command is: http://<ip>:<port>/devtools/ping.php?ip=127.0.0.1%26cat+%2Fetc%2Fpasswd%26
# Need to change to: http://<ip>:<port>/devtools/ping.php?ip=127.0.0.1%26cat+%2Fflag.txt%26 and send request

# OR 

# You can find some useful info going to "Customer Suport" on main page and next to comment with link:
# https://94.237.59.180:46123/devtools/ping.php?ip=127.0.0.1%26pwd;hostname;cat+%2Fflag.txt%26
# Which you can modify and get answer right in your browser 
# (don't forget to convert special characters '&' and '/' to '%26' and '%2F')
``` 

### Extensions

```
# Both Burp and ZAP have extension capabilities, such that the community of Burp users can develop extensions for Burp for everyone to use.
# Burp allows extensibility through its Extender feature and its BApp Store, while ZAP has its ZAP Marketplace to install new plugins.
```

```
# BApp Store

# To find all available extensions, we can click on the Extender tab within Burp and select the BApp Store sub-tab.
