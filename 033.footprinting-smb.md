### Server Message Block (SMB)
```
# SMB first became available to a broader public, for example, as part of the OS/2 network operating system LAN Manager and LAN Server. 
# Windows OS related
# In IP networks, SMB uses TCP protocol for this purpose, which provides for a three-way handshake during connnection.
# Access rights are defined by Access Control Lists (ACL). 
# They can be controlled in a fine-grained manner based on attributes such as execute, read, and full access for individual users or user groups.
```

### Samba
```
# Linux OS related, developed for Unix-based operating system.
# Samba implements the Common Internet File System (CIFS) network protocol. CIFS is a "dialect" of SMB.
# This allows Samba to communicate with newer Windows systems. Therefore, it usually is referred to as SMB / CIFS.
# However, CIFS is the extension of the SMB protocol. 
# So when we pass SMB commands over Samba to an older NetBIOS service, 
# it usually connects to the Samba server over TCP ports 137, 138, 139, but CIFS uses TCP port 445 only.
```

```

# We know that Samba is suitable for both Linux and Windows systems. In a network, each host participates in the same workgroup. 
# IBM developed an application programming interface (API) for networking computers called the Network Basic Input/Output System (NetBIOS).
# The NetBIOS API provided a blueprint for an application to connect and share data with other computers. 
# Either each host reserves its hostname on the network, or the NetBIOS Name Server (NBNS) is used for this purpose. 
# It also has been enhanced to Windows Internet Name Service (WINS).
