### LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning - from Linux

```
# In this phase, we will work through two different techniques side-by-side: network poisoning and password spraying.
# This section and the next will cover a common way to gather credentials and gain an initial foothold during an assessment: 
# a Man-in-the-Middle attack on Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) and NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) broadcasts. 
```

### LLMNR & NBT-NS Primer

[Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4795)
[NetBIOS Name Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-2000-server/cc940063(v=technet.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN)

```
# Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) and NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) are Microsoft Windows components that serve as alternate methods 
# of host identification that can be used when DNS fails. If a machine attempts to resolve a host but DNS resolution fails, typically, 
# the machine will try to ask all other machines on the local network for the correct host address via LLMNR. 
# LLMNR is based upon the Domain Name System (DNS) format and allows hosts on the same local link to perform name resolution for other hosts. 
# It uses port 5355 over UDP natively. If LLMNR fails, the NBT-NS will be used. NBT-NS identifies systems on a local network by their NetBIOS name. 
# NBT-NS utilizes port 137 over UDP. 

# The kicker here is that when LLMNR/NBT-NS are used for name resolution, ANY host on the network can reply. 
# This is where we come in with Responder to poison these requests. 
```

### Quick Example - LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning

```
# Let's walk through a quick example of the attack flow at a very high level:

- A host attempts to connect to the print server at \\print01.inlanefreight.local, but accidentally types in \\printer01.inlanefreight.local.
- The DNS server responds, stating that this host is unknown.
- The host then broadcasts out to the entire local network asking if anyone knows the location of \\printer01.inlanefreight.local.
- The attacker (us with Responder running) responds to the host stating that it is the \\printer01.inlanefreight.local that the host is looking for.
- The host believes this reply and sends an authentication request to the attacker with a username and NTLMv2 password hash.
- This hash can then be cracked offline or used in an SMB Relay attack if the right conditions exist.
```

### TTPs

[Responder](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder)
[Inveigh](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Inveigh)
[Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/)

[Hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/)
[John](https://www.openwall.com/john/)

```
# We are performing these actions to collect authentication information sent over the network in the form of NTLMv1 and NTLMv2 password hashes.
# NTLMv1 and NTLMv2 are authentication protocols that utilize the LM or NT hash. 
# We will then take the hash and attempt to crack them offline using tools such as Hashcat or John 
# with the goal of obtaining the account's cleartext password to be used to gain an initial foothold 
# or expand our access within the domain if we capture a password hash for an account with more privileges 
# than an account that we currently possess.
```

```
# Several tools can be used to attempt LLMNR & NBT-NS poisoning:

Responder      # Responder is a purpose-built tool to poison LLMNR, NBT-NS, and MDNS, with many different functions.
Inveigh        # Inveigh is a cross-platform MITM platform that can be used for spoofing and poisoning attacks.
Metasploit     # Metasploit has several built-in scanners and spoofing modules made to deal with poisoning attacks.
```

```
# Using Responder and Inveigh to capture password hashes and attempt to crack them offline. 
# We commonly start an internal penetration test from an anonymous position on the client's internal network with a Linux attack host. 
# Tools such as Responder are great for establishing a foothold that we can later expand upon through further enumeration and attacks. 
# Responder is written in Python and typically used on a Linux attack host, though there is a .exe version that works on Windows. 
# Inveigh is written in both C# and PowerShell (considered legacy). 

# Both tools can be used to attack the following protocols:

  LLMNR
  DNS
  MDNS
  NBNS
  DHCP
  ICMP
  HTTP
  HTTPS
  SMB
  LDAP
  WebDAV
  Proxy Auth

# Responder also has support for:

  MSSQL
  DCE-RPC
  FTP, POP3, IMAP, and SMTP auth
```

### Responder In Action

```
# In the Initial Enumeration section earlier, we utilized Responder in Analysis (passive) mode. 
# This means it listened for any resolution requests, but did not answer them or send out poisoned packets. 
# We were acting like a fly on the wall, just listening. 
# Now, we will take things a step further and let Responder do what it does best. 
# Let's look at some options available by typing responder -h into our console.

# If you are successful and manage to capture a hash, Responder will print it out on screen 
# and write it to a log file per host located in the `/usr/share/responder/logs` directory. 
# Hashes are saved in the format (MODULE_NAME)-(HASH_TYPE)-(CLIENT_IP).txt
```

```
# We must run the tool with sudo privileges or as root and make sure the following ports are available on our attack host for it to function best:

UDP 137, UDP 138, UDP 53, UDP/TCP 389,TCP 1433, UDP 1434, TCP 80, TCP 135, TCP 139, TCP 445, 
TCP 21, TCP 3141,TCP 25, TCP 110, TCP 587, TCP 3128, Multicast UDP 5355 and 5353
```

```
# Starting Responder with Default Settings

sudo responder -I ens224 

# Once we are ready, we can pass these hashes to Hashcat using hash mode 5600 for NTLMv2 hashes that we typically obtain with Responder. 
# We may at times obtain NTLMv1 hashes and other types of hashes and can consult the Hashcat example hashes page 
# to identify them and find the proper hash mode. 
```

[Hashcat example hashes page](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes) 

```
hashcat -m 5600 forend_ntlmv2 /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt   # Cracking an NTLMv2 Hash With Hashcat (where hash?)

# Looking at the results above, we can see we cracked the NET-NTLMv2 hash for user FOREND, whose password is Klmcargo2. 
# Lucky for us our target domain allows weak 8-character passwords. 
# This hash type can be "slow" to crack even on a GPU cracking rig, so large and complex passwords may be more difficult 
# or impossible to crack within a reasonable amount of time.
```

### Task Solution

```
ssh htb-student@10.129.40.72 -p "HTB_@cademy_stdnt!"               # ssh to internal init host with pass "HTB_@cademy_stdnt!"
sudo responder -I ens224                                           # start responder on init host  (waiting till user on b.. will appear)
hashcat -m 5600 hash_backupagent /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt  # Faced with "hardware"/compiler error on init host, but ok on localhost

# making the same with responder to grab second "wley" user hash and decrypt the plaintext password with hascat
```

### LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning - from Windows

```
# LLMNR & NBT-NS poisoning is possible from a Windows host as well. 
# In the last section, we utilized Responder to capture hashes. 
# This section will explore the tool Inveigh and attempt to capture another set of credentials.
```

### Inveigh - Overview

[Inveigh](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Inveigh)

```
# The tool Inveigh works similar to Responder, but is written in PowerShell and C#. 
# Inveigh can listen to IPv4 and IPv6 and several other protocols, 
# including LLMNR, DNS, mDNS, NBNS, DHCPv6, ICMPv6, HTTP, HTTPS, SMB, LDAP, WebDAV, and Proxy Auth.
```

### Using Inveigh

```
# We can get started with the PowerShell version as follows and then list all possible parameters. 
# There is a wiki that lists all parameters and usage instructions. :

PS C:\htb> Import-Module .\Inveigh.ps1

```
# Inveigh with LLMNR and NBNS spoofing
PS C:\htb> Invoke-Inveigh Y -NBNS Y -ConsoleOutput Y -FileOutput Y
```

### C# Inveigh (InveighZero)

```# 
# The tool author maintains the C# version, which combines the original PoC C# code 
# and a C# port of most of the code from the PowerShell version.

PS C:\htb> .\Inveigh.exe

# The options with a [+] are default and enabled by default and the ones with a [ ] before them are disabled. 
# The running console output also shows us which options are disabled and, therefore, responses are not being sent (mDNS in the above example). 
# We can also see the message Press ESC to enter/exit interactive console, which is very useful while running the tool. 

# After typing HELP and hitting enter, we are presented with several options:

C(0:0) NTLMv1(0:0) NTLMv2(3:9)> HELP

# We can quickly view unique captured hashes by typing : 

GET NTLMV2UNIQUE

# We can type in :

GET NTLMV2USERNAMES 

# and see which usernames we have collected. 
# This is helpful if we want a listing of users to perform additional enumeration against 
# and see which are worth attempting to crack offline using Hashcat.
```

### Remediation

```
# Mitre ATT&CK lists this technique as ID: T1557.001, Adversary-in-the-Middle: LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay.

# There are a few ways to mitigate this attack. To ensure that these spoofing attacks are not possible, we can disable LLMNR and NBT-NS. 
# As a word of caution, it is always worth slowly testing out a significant change like this to your environment carefully before rolling it out fully.

# We can disable LLMNR in Group Policy by going to 
# Computer Configuration --> Administrative Templates --> Network --> DNS Client and enabling "Turn OFF Multicast Name Resolution."
```

```
# NBT-NS cannot be disabled via Group Policy but must be disabled locally on each host. 
# We can do this by opening Network and Sharing Center under Control Panel, clicking on Change adapter settings, 
# right-clicking on the adapter to view its properties, selecting Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4), 
# and clicking the Properties button, then clicking on Advanced and selecting the WINS tab and finally selecting Disable NetBIOS over TCP/IP.
```

```
# While it is not possible to disable NBT-NS directly via GPO, 
# we can create a PowerShell script under Computer Configuration --> Windows Settings --> 
# Script (Startup/Shutdown) --> Startup with something like the following:

$regkey = "HKLM:SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\NetBT\Parameters\Interfaces"
Get-ChildItem $regkey |foreach { Set-ItemProperty -Path "$regkey\$($_.pschildname)" -Name NetbiosOptions -Value 2 -Verbose}
```

```
# In the Local Group Policy Editor, we will need to double click on Startup, choose the PowerShell Scripts tab, 
# and select "For this GPO, run scripts in the following order" to Run Windows PowerShell scripts first, 
# and then click on Add and choose the script. 
# For these changes to occur, we would have to either reboot the target system or restart the network adapter.
```

```
# To push this out to all hosts in a domain, we could create a GPO using Group Policy Management 
# on the Domain Controller and host the script on the SYSVOL share in the scripts folder and then call it via its UNC path such as:

\\inlanefreight.local\SYSVOL\INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\scripts

# Once the GPO is applied to specific OUs and those hosts are restarted, 
# the script will run at the next reboot and disable NBT-NS, 
# provided that the script still exists on the SYSVOL share and is accessible by the host over the network.
```

```
# Other mitigations include filtering network traffic to block LLMNR/NetBIOS traffic 
# and enabling SMB Signing to prevent NTLM relay attacks. 
# Network intrusion detection and prevention systems can also be used to mitigate this activity, 
# while network segmentation can be used to isolate hosts that require LLMNR or NetBIOS enabled to operate correctly.
```

### Detection

[pretorian-blog](https://www.praetorian.com/blog/a-simple-and-effective-way-to-detect-broadcast-name-resolution-poisoning-bnrp/)
[event-4697](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-10/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4697)
[event-7045](https://www.manageengine.com/products/active-directory-audit/kb/system-events/event-id-7045.html)

```
# It is not always possible to disable LLMNR and NetBIOS, and therefore we need ways to detect this type of attack behavior. 
# One way is to use the attack against the attackers by injecting LLMNR and NBT-NS requests for non-existent hosts across different subnets 
# and alerting if any of the responses receive answers which would be indicative of an attacker spoofing name resolution responses. 
# This blog post above explains this method more in-depth.

# Furthermore, hosts can be monitored for traffic on ports UDP 5355 and 137, and event IDs 4697 and 7045 can be monitored for. 
# Finally, we can monitor the registry key HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\DNSClient 
# for changes to the EnableMulticast DWORD value. A value of 0 would mean that LLMNR is disabled.
```
