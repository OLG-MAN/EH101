### Search Engine Discovery

```
# Why Search Engine Discovery Matters

- Open Source: The information gathered is publicly accessible, making it a legal and ethical way to gain insights into a target.

- Breadth of Information: Search engines index a vast portion of the web, offering a wide range of potential information sources.

- Ease of Use: Search engines are user-friendly and require no specialised technical skills.

- Cost-Effective: It's a free and readily available resource for information gathering.
```

```
# The information you can pull together from Search Engines can be applied in several different ways as well:
- Security Assessment: Identifying vulnerabilities, exposed data, and potential attack vectors.
- Competitive Intelligence: Gathering information about competitors' products, services, and strategies.
- Investigative Journalism: Uncovering hidden connections, financial transactions, and unethical practices.
- Threat Intelligence: Identifying emerging threats, tracking malicious actors, and predicting potential attacks.
```

### Google Dorking
[Google Hacking Database](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database)

```
# Is a technique that leverages the power of search operators to uncover sensitive information, 
# security vulnerabilities, or hidden content on websites, using Google Search.


# Here are some common examples of Google Dorks, for more examples, refer to the Google Hacking Database:

- inding Login Pages:
site:example.com inurl:login
site:example.com (inurl:login OR inurl:admin)

- Identifying Exposed Files:
site:example.com filetype:pdf
site:example.com (filetype:xls OR filetype:docx)

- Uncovering Configuration Files:
site:example.com inurl:config.php
site:example.com (ext:conf OR ext:cnf) (searches for extensions commonly used for configuration files)

- Locating Database Backups:
site:example.com inurl:backup
site:example.com filetype:sql
```


### Web Archives
[Internet Archive's Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/)
```
# In the fast-paced digital world, websites come and go, leaving only fleeting traces of their existence behind. 
# However, thanks to the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, 
# we have a unique opportunity to revisit the past and explore the digital footprints of websites as they once were.

# How Does the Wayback Machine Work?
# The Wayback Machine operates by using web crawlers to capture snapshots of websites at regular intervals automatically. 
# These crawlers navigate through the web, following links and indexing pages, much like how search engine crawlers work.

# The Wayback Machine's operation can be visualized as a three-step process:
- Crawling
- Archiving
- Accessing
```

```
# Why the Wayback Machine Matters for Web Reconnaissance:

- Uncovering Hidden Assets and Vulnerabilities
# The Wayback Machine allows you to discover old web pages, directories, files, or subdomains 
# that might not be accessible on the current website, potentially exposing sensitive information or security flaws.

- Tracking Changes and Identifying Patterns:
# By comparing historical snapshots, you can observe how the website has evolved, revealing changes in 
# structure, content, technologies, and potential vulnerabilities.

- Gathering Intelligence: 
# Archived content can be a valuable source of OSINT, providing insights into the target's past 
# activities, marketing strategies, employees, and technology choices.

- Stealthy Reconnaissance: 
# Accessing archived snapshots is a passive activity that doesn't directly interact with the target's infrastructure, 
# making it a less detectable way to gather information.
```
