### DNS Records

```
# To connect to academy.htb, we would have to add it to our /etc/hosts file. We can achieve that with the following command:

sudo sh -c 'echo "SERVER_IP  academy.htb" >> /etc/hosts'

# However, we get the same website we got when we visit the IP directly, so academy.htb is the same domain we have been testing so far. 
# We can verify that by visiting /blog/index.php, and see that we can access the page.

# When we run our tests on this IP, we did not find anything about admin or panels, even when we did a full recursive scan on our target. 
# So, in this case, we start looking for sub-domains under '*.academy.htb' and see if we find anything, 
# which is what we will attempt in the next section.
```

### Sub-domain Fuzzing

```
# Luckily for us, in the SecLists repo, there is a specific section for sub-domain wordlists, 
# consisting of common words usually used for sub-domains. 
# We can find it in ../Discovery/DNS/.. 
# In our case, we would be using a shorter wordlist, which is subdomains-top1million-5000.txt. 
# If we want to extend our scan, we can pick a larger list.

# As for our target, we will use inlanefreight.com as our target and run our scan on it. 
# Let us use ffuf and place the FUZZ keyword in the place of sub-domains, and see if we get any hits:

ffuf -w ./SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt:FUZZ -u https://FUZZ.inlanefreight.com/

# We see that we do get a few hits back. 
# Now, we can try running the same thing on academy.htb and see if we get any hits back:

ffuf -w ./SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt:FUZZ -u http://FUZZ.academy.htb/

# We see that we do not get any hits back. Does this mean that there are no sub-domain under academy.htb? - No.

# This means that there are no public sub-domains under academy.htb, 
# as it does not have a public DNS record, as previously mentioned. 

# Even though we did add academy.htb to our /etc/hosts file, we only added the main domain, 
# so when ffuf is looking for other sub-domains, it will not find them in /etc/hosts, 
# and will ask the public DNS, which obviously will not have them.
```

### Task Solution

```
ffuf -ic -w ./SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt:FUZZ -u https://FUZZ.inlanefreight.com/
```

### Vhost Fuzzing

```
# As we saw in the previous section, we were able to fuzz public sub-domains using public DNS records. 
# However, when it came to fuzzing sub-domains that do not have a public DNS record or sub-domains under websites that are not public, 
# we could not use the same method. In this section, we will learn how to do that with Vhost Fuzzing.
```

### Vhosts vs. Sub-domains

```
# The key difference between VHosts and sub-domains is that a VHost is basically 
# a 'sub-domain' served on the same server and has the same IP, 
# such that a single IP could be serving two or more different websites.

# VHosts may or may not have public DNS records.
```

```
# To scan for VHosts, without manually adding the entire wordlist to our /etc/hosts, 
# we will be fuzzing HTTP headers, specifically the Host: header. 
# To do that, we can use the -H flag to specify a header and will use the FUZZ keyword within it, as follows:

ffuf -ic -w ./SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt:FUZZ -u http://academy.htb:PORT/ -H 'Host: FUZZ.academy.htb'

# We see that all words in the wordlist are returning 200 OK! 
# This is expected, as we are simply changing the header while visiting http://academy.htb:PORT/. 
# So, we know that we will always get 200 OK. 

# However, if the VHost does exist and we send a correct one in the header, 
# we should get a different response size, as in that case, we would be getting the page from that VHosts, 
# which is likely to show a different page.
```

### Filtering Results

```
# Ffuf provides the option to match or filter out a specific HTTP code, response size, or amount of words. 
# We can see that with ffuf -h:

MATCHER OPTIONS:
  -mc              Match HTTP status codes, or "all" for everything. (default: 200,204,301,302,307,401,403)
  -ml              Match amount of lines in response
  -mr              Match regexp
  -ms              Match HTTP response size
  -mw              Match amount of words in response

FILTER OPTIONS:
  -fc              Filter HTTP status codes from response. Comma separated list of codes and ranges
  -fl              Filter by amount of lines in response. Comma separated list of line counts and ranges
  -fr              Filter regexp
  -fs              Filter HTTP response size. Comma separated list of sizes and ranges
  -fw              Filter by amount of words in response. Comma separated list of word counts and ranges
...
```

```
# In this case, we cannot use matching, as we don't know what the response size from other VHosts would be. 
# We know the response size of the incorrect results, which, as seen from the test above, is 900, a
# nd we can filter it out with -fs 900. 
# Now, let's repeat the same previous command, add the above flag, and see what we get:

ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt:FUZZ -u http://academy.htb:PORT/ -H 'Host: FUZZ.academy.htb' -fs 900

# We can verify that by visiting the page, and seeing if we can connect to it:

# Note 1: Don't forget to add "admin.academy.htb" to "/etc/hosts".
# Note 2: If your exercise has been restarted, ensure you still have the correct port when visiting the website.

# We see that we can access the page, but we get an empty page, unlike what we got with academy.htb, therefore confirming this is indeed a different VHost. We can even visit https://admin.academy.htb:PORT/blog/index.php, and we will see that we would get a 404 PAGE NOT FOUND, confirming that we are now indeed on a different VHost.
```

### Task Solution

```
83.136.255.47:46505

sudo sh -c 'echo "83.136.255.47 academy.htb" >> /etc/hosts'

# check that default respone size is 986 (not 900 as in guide) and define it in a command:
ffuf -w ./SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt:FUZZ -u http://academy.htb:46505/ -H 'Host: FUZZ.academy.htb' -fs 986

# don't forget add a academy.htb for sub-domain in answer
```
