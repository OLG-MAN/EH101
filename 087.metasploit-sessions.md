### Sessions

```
# MSFconsole can manage multiple modules at the same time. 
# This is one of the many reasons it provides the user with so much flexibility. 
# This is done with the use of Sessions, which creates dedicated control interfaces for all of your deployed modules.

# Once several sessions are created, we can switch between them and link a different module to one of the backgrounded sessions 
# to run on it or turn them into jobs. 
# Note that once a session is placed in the background, it will continue to run, and our connection to the target host will persist. 
# Sessions can, however, die if something goes wrong during the payload runtime, causing the communication channel to tear down.
```

```
# While running any available exploits or auxiliary modules in msfconsole,
#  we can background the session as long as they form a channel of communication with the target host. 
# This can be done either by pressing the [CTRL] + [Z] key combination or by typing the background command in the case of Meterpreter stages.

msf6 exploit(windows/smb/psexec_psh) > sessions                  # view active session inside used module
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/psexec_psh) > sessions -i 1             # Use sessions -i [no.] command to open up a specific session.
output:
[*] Starting interaction with 1...
```

### Jobs

```
# If, for example, we are running an active exploit under a specific port and need this port for a different module, 
# we cannot simply terminate the session using [CTRL] + [C]. 
# If we did that, we would see that the port would still be in use, affecting our use of the new module. 
# So instead, we would need to use the `jobs` command to look at the currently active tasks running in the background 
# and terminate the old ones to free up the port.

msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > jobs -h                      # Check options of job command

# When we run an exploit, we can run it as a job by typing exploit -j. 
# Per the help menu for the exploit command, adding -j to our command. 
# Instead of just exploit or run, will "run it in the context of a job."

msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > exploit -h                  # Check available options
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > exploit -j                  # Run exploit in the context of a job
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > jobs -l                     # Listing Running Jobs
output:
