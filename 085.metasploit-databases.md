### Databases

```
# Msfconsole has built-in support for the PostgreSQL database system. 
# With it, we have direct, quick, and easy access to scan results with the added ability to import and export results in conjunction with third-party tools. 
# Database entries can also be used to configure Exploit module parameters with the already existing findings directly.

# Spin-up PostgreSQL service 

sudo service postgresql status       # check service status
sudo systemctl start postgresql      # start service
sudo msfdb init                      # MSF - Initiate a Database

# Note: Sometimes an error can occur if Metasploit is not up to date. Update Metasploit again (apt update) to solve this problem

sudo msfdb status                    # check status of started before `msfdb` service
sudo msfdb run                       # start/run msfdb 

# If, however, we already have the database configured and are not able to change the password to the MSF username, proceed with these commands:

msfdb reinit
cp /usr/share/metasploit-framework/config/database.yml ~/.msf4/
sudo service postgresql restart
msfconsole -q
```

```
# With the help of the database, we can manage many different categories and hosts that we have analyzed. 
# Alternatively, the information about them that we have interacted with using Metasploit. 
# These databases can be exported and imported. 

msf6 > help database                 # list MSF Database Options
```

### Workspaces

```
# We can think of Workspaces the same way we would think of folders in a project. 
# We can segregate the different scan results, hosts, and extracted information by IP, subnet, network, or domain.

msf6 > workspace -h                  # help for command
msf6 > workspace                     # List existed workspaces
msf6 > workspace -a Target_1         # Add a Workspace
msf6 > workspace Target_1            # Choose and use target Workspace (after marked by * in list)
msf6 > workspace -d Target_1         # Delete target Workspace
```

### Importing Scan Results (?)

```
# Next, let us assume we want to import a Nmap scan of a host into our Database's Workspace to understand the target better. 
# We can use the db_import command for this. 
# After the import is complete, we can check the presence of the host's information in our database by using the hosts and services commands. 
# Note that the .xml file type is preferred for db_import.

(?? Weird piece of guide, where nmap commands first, why .nmap/.xml  ??)

cat Target.nmap                      # check info in saved file after nmap scan
msf6 > db_import Target.xml          # Importing Scan Results
msf6 > hosts                         # List ussed hosts after nmap (?)
msf6 > services                      # List services on this/these host/s

msf6 > db_nmap -sV -sS 10.10.10.8    # Using nmap for target host inside msfconsole\
msf6 > hosts                         # Check that this host appear in msfdb after scaning by nmap
msf6 > services                      # Check services on appeared host inside msfdb
```

### Data Backup

```
# After finishing the session, make sure to back up our data if anything happens with the PostgreSQL service. 
# To do so, use the db_export command:

msf6 > db_export -h                    # help man for command
msf6 > db_export -f xml backup.xml     # export data from db workspace to backup file (.xml)

# This data can be imported back to msfconsole later when needed. 
# Other commands related to data retention are the extended use of hosts, services, and the creds and loot commands.
```

### Hosts

```
# The hosts command displays a database table automatically populated with the host addresses, hostnames, 
# and other information we find about these during our scans and interactions. 

msf6 > hosts -h              # check options of command
```

### Services

```
# The services command functions the same way as the previous one. 
# It contains a table with descriptions and information on services discovered during scans or interactions. 

msf6 > services -h           # check options of command
```

### Credentials

```
# The creds command allows you to visualize the credentials gathered during your interactions with the target host. 
# We can also add credentials manually, match existing credentials with port specifications, add descriptions, etc.

msf6 > creds -h              # check options of command
```

### Loot

```
# The loot command works in conjunction with the command above to offer you an at-a-glance list of owned services and users. 
# The loot, in this case, refers to hash dumps from different system types, namely hashes, passwd, shadow, and more.

msf6 > loot -h              # check options of command
```
