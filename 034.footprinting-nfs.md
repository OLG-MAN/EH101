### NFS
```
# Basic info
# NFS is used between Linux and Unix systems. This means that NFS clients cannot communicate directly with SMB servers. 
# NFS is an Internet standard that governs the procedures in a distributed file system. 
# While NFS protocol version 3.0 (NFSv3), which has been in use for many years, authenticates the client computer, this changes with NFSv4. 
# Here, as with the Windows SMB protocol, the user must authenticate.
#
# NFS is based on the Open Network Computing Remote Procedure Call (ONC-RPC/SUN-RPC) protocol exposed on TCP and UDP ports 111, 
# which uses External Data Representation (XDR) for the system-independent exchange of data. 



# Versions
NFSv2	# It is older but is supported by many systems and was initially operated entirely over UDP.
NFSv3	# It has more features, including variable file size and better error reporting, but is not fully compatible with NFSv2 clients.
NFSv4	# It includes Kerberos, works through firewalls and on the Internet, no longer requires portmappers, supports ACLs, applies state-based operations, 
        # and provides performance improvements and high security. It is also the first version to have a stateful protocol.
```

### NFS exports Table (example)
```
cat /etc/exports 

# /etc/exports: the access control list for filesystems which may be exported
#               to NFS clients.  See exports(5).
#
# Example for NFSv2 and NFSv3:
# /srv/homes       hostname1(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) hostname2(ro,sync,no_subtree_check)
#
# Example for NFSv4:
# /srv/nfs4        gss/krb5i(rw,sync,fsid=0,crossmnt,no_subtree_check)
# /srv/nfs4/homes  gss/krb5i(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
```

```
# Other Settings
rw	               # Read and write permissions.
ro	               # Read only permissions.
sync	           # Synchronous data transfer. (A bit slower)
async	           # Asynchronous data transfer. (A bit faster)
secure	           # Ports above 1024 will not be used.
insecure	       # Ports above 1024 will be used.
no_subtree_check   # This option disables the checking of subdirectory trees.
root_squash        # Assigns all permissions to files of root UID/GID 0 to the UID/GID of anonymous, 
                   # which prevents root from accessing files on an NFS mount.

# Dangerous Settings
rw	             # Read and write permissions.
insecure	     # Ports above 1024 will be used.
nohide	         # If another file system was mounted below an exported directory, this directory is exported by its own exports entry.
no_root_squash	 # All files created by root are kept with the UID/GID 0.

# ExportFS 
echo '/mnt/nfs  10.129.14.0/24(sync,no_subtree_check)' >> /etc/exports
systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server
exportfs

output:
/mnt/nfs      	10.129.14.0/24
```

### Footprinting the Service
```
# Essential ports of NFS - 111 and 2049
# Scanning with nmap
sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -p111,2049 -sV -sC

# More detailed connection info with NFS NSE scripts
sudo nmap --script nfs* 10.129.14.128 -sV -p111,2049

# Show available NFS shares
showmount -e 10.129.14.128

# Mounting target NFS Share to localhost
mkdir target-NFS
sudo mount -t nfs 10.129.14.128:/ ./target-NFS/ -o nolock
cd target-NFS
tree .

# List Contents with Usernames & Group Names
ls -l mnt/nfs/

# List Contents with UIDs & GUIDs
ls -n mnt/nfs/

# Unmounting
cd ..
sudo umount ./target-NFS
```
