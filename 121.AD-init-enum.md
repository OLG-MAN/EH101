### External Recon and Enumeration Principles

```
# Before kicking off any pentest, it can be beneficial to perform external reconnaissance of your target. 
# This can serve many different functions, such as:

- Validating information provided to you in the scoping document from the client
- Ensuring you are taking actions against the appropriate scope when working remotely
- Looking for any information that is publicly accessible that can affect the outcome of your test, such as leaked credentials
```

### What Are We Looking For?

```
- IP Space 	
# Valid ASN for our target, netblocks in use for the organization's public-facing infrastructure, cloud presence and the hosting providers, DNS record entries, etc.

- Domain Information 	
# Based on IP data, DNS, and site registrations. Who administers the domain? Are there any subdomains tied to our target? 
# Are there any publicly accessible domain services present? (Mailservers, DNS, Websites, VPN portals, etc.) 
# Can we determine what kind of defenses are in place? (SIEM, AV, IPS/IDS in use, etc.)

- Schema Format 	
# Can we discover the organization's email accounts, AD usernames, and even password policies? 
# Anything that will give us information we can use to build a valid username list to test external-facing services 
# for password spraying, credential stuffing, brute forcing, etc.

- Data Disclosures 	
# For data disclosures we will be looking for publicly accessible files ( .pdf, .ppt, .docx, .xlsx, etc. ) 
# for any information that helps shed light on the target. For example, any published files that contain intranet site listings, 
# user metadata, shares, or other critical software or hardware in the environment 
# (credentials pushed to a public GitHub repo, the internal AD username format in the metadata of a PDF, for example.)

- Breach Data 	
# Any publicly released usernames, passwords, or other critical information that can help an attacker gain a foothold.

- ASN / IP registrars 	
# IANA, arin for searching the Americas, RIPE for searching in Europe, BGP Toolkit

- Domain Registrars & DNS 	
# Domaintools, PTRArchive, ICANN, manual DNS record requests against the domain in question 
# or against well known DNS servers, such as 8.8.8.8.

- Social Media 	
# Searching Linkedin, Twitter, Facebook, your region's major social media sites, news articles, 
# and any relevant info you can find about the organization.


- Public-Facing Company Websites 	
# Often, the public website for a corporation will have relevant info embedded. 
# News articles, embedded documents, and the "About Us" and "Contact Us" pages can also be gold mines.

- Cloud & Dev Storage Spaces 	
# GitHub, AWS S3 buckets & Azure Blog storage containers, Google searches using "Dorks"

- Breach Data Sources 	
# HaveIBeenPwned to determine if any corporate email accounts appear in public breach data, 
# Dehashed to search for corporate emails with cleartext passwords or hashes we can try to crack offline. 
# We can then try these passwords against any exposed login portals 
# (Citrix, RDS, OWA, 0365, VPN, VMware Horizon, custom applications, etc.) that may use AD authentication.
```

# Username Harvesting

# We can use a tool such as linkedin2username to scrape data from a company's LinkedIn page 
# and create various mashups of usernames (flast, first.last, f.last, etc.) 
# that can be added to our list of potential password spraying targets.

Credential Hunting

Dehashed is an excellent tool for hunting for cleartext credentials and password hashes in breach data. We can search either on the site or using a script that performs queries via the API. Typically we will find many old passwords for users that do not work on externally-facing portals that use AD auth (or internal), but we may get lucky! This is another tool that can be useful for creating a user list for external or internal password spraying.

### Initial Enumeration of the Domain

```
Key Data Points

AD Users 	             # We are trying to enumerate valid user accounts we can target for password spraying.
AD Joined Computers 	 # Key Computers include Domain Controllers, file servers, SQL servers, web servers, Exchange mail servers, DB etc.
Key Services 	         # Kerberos, NetBIOS, LDAP, DNS
Vulnerable Hosts and Services 	# Anything that can be a quick win. ( a.k.a an easy host to exploit and gain a foothold)
```

### Identifying Hosts

```
# We can use Wireshark and TCPDump to "put our ear to the wire" and see what hosts and types of network traffic we can capture. 
# This is particularly helpful if the assessment approach is "black box." We notice some ARP requests and replies, 
# MDNS, and other basic layer two packets (since we are on a switched network, we are limited to the current broadcast domain) 
# some of which we can see below. 
# This is a great start that gives us a few bits of information about the customer's network setup.

sudo -E wireshark        # Start Wireshark on ea-attack01
```

```
# If we are on a host without a GUI (which is typical), we can use tcpdump, net-creds, and NetMiner, etc.
# We can also use tcpdump to save a capture to a .pcap file, transfer it to another host, and open it in Wireshark.

sudo tcpdump -i ens224   # Tcpdump Output

# Depending on the host you are on, you may already have a network monitoring tool built-in, such as pktmon.exe, 
# which was added to all editions of Windows 10. 
# As a note for testing, it's always a good idea to save the PCAP traffic you capture. 
```

https://github.com/lgandx/Responder-Windows

```
# Responder is a tool built to listen, analyze, and poison LLMNR, NBT-NS, and MDNS requests and responses. 
# It has many more functions, but for now, all we are utilizing is the tool in its Analyze mode. 
# This will passively listen to the network and not send any poisoned packets. 

sudo responder -I ens224 -A 
```

https://fping.org/

```
# Fping provides us with a similar capability as the standard ping application in that it utilizes ICMP requests 
# and replies to reach out and interact with a host. 
# Where fping shines is in its ability to issue ICMP packets against a list of multiple hosts at once and its scriptability. 

fping -asgq 172.16.5.0/23

# From the fping command, we can see X "live hosts," including our attack host.
```

```
# Now that we have a list of active hosts within our network, we can enumerate those hosts further. 
# We are looking to determine what services each host is running, identify critical hosts such as 
# Domain Controllers and web servers, and identify potentially vulnerable hosts to probe later. 

sudo nmap -v -A -iL hosts.txt -oN /home/htb-student/Documents/host-enum      # run nmap against scrapped host list with fping
```

### Kerbrute - Internal AD Username Enumeration

https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute

https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute/releases/latest

https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames


```
# Kerbrute can be a stealthier option for domain account enumeration. 
# It takes advantage of the fact that Kerberos pre-authentication failures often will not trigger logs or alerts. 
# We will use Kerbrute in conjunction with the jsmith.txt or jsmith2.txt user lists from Insidetrust. 

# To get started with Kerbrute, we can download precompiled binaries for the tool for testing from Linux, Windows, and Mac, 
# or we can compile it ourselves (commands below):

sudo git clone https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute.git
make help
sudo make all
```

```
./kerbrute_linux_amd64                                  # Testing the kerbrute_linux_amd64
sudo mv kerbrute_linux_amd64 /usr/local/bin/kerbrute    # move tool to PATH if fneed 

kerbrute userenum -d INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL --dc 172.16.5.5 jsmith.txt -o valid_ad_users   # Start enum against known host and user list
```

### Identifying Potential Vulnerabilities

```
# There are several ways to gain SYSTEM-level access on a host, including but not limited to:

- Remote Windows exploits such as MS08-067, EternalBlue, or BlueKeep.
- Abusing a service running in the context of the SYSTEM account, or abusing the service account SeImpersonate privileges using Juicy Potato.
  This type of attack is possible on older Windows OS' but not always possible with Windows Server 2019.
- Local privilege escalation flaws in Windows operating systems such as the Windows 10 Task Scheduler 0-day.
- Gaining admin access on a domain-joined host with a local account and using Psexec to launch a SYSTEM cmd window
```

```
# By gaining SYSTEM-level access on a domain-joined host, you will be able to perform actions such as, but not limited to:

- Enumerate the domain using built-in tools or offensive tools such as BloodHound and PowerView.
- Perform Kerberoasting / ASREPRoasting attacks within the same domain.
- Run tools such as Inveigh to gather Net-NTLMv2 hashes or perform SMB relay attacks.
- Perform token impersonation to hijack a privileged domain user account.
- Carry out ACL attacks.
```

### Task solution

```
ssh htb-student@10.129.239.194 HTB_@cademy_stdnt!    # Login to pentest host (inner)
sudo nmap -A 172.16.5.5                              # Scan taret host , get answer from output
fping -asgq 172.16.5.0/23                            # Scan subnetwork, only 3 host in output so I tried them on answer
```
