### Burp Intruder

```
# Both Burp and ZAP provide additional features other than the default web proxy, 
# which are essential for web application penetration testing. 
# Two of the most important extra features are web fuzzers and web scanners. 

# The built-in web fuzzers are powerful tools that act as web fuzzing, enumeration, and brute-forcing tools. 
# This may also act as an alternative for many of the CLI-based fuzzers we use, like:
# ffuf, dirbuster, gobuster, wfuzz, among others.

# The main con is the Burp Community version is throttled at a speed of 1 request per second, 
# making it extremely slow compared to CLI-based web fuzzing tools, 
# which can usually read up to 10k requests per second.

# So we can Burp Intruder only for short queries.
```

### Target

```
# As usual, we'll start up Burp and its pre-configured browser and then visit the web application. 
# Once we do, we can go to the Proxy History, locate our request, then right-click on the request and select Send to Intruder, 
# or use the shortcut [CTRL+I] to send it to Intruder.

# We can then go to Intruder by clicking on its tab or with the shortcut [CTRL+SHIFT+I], which takes us right to Burp Intruder.
```

### Positions

```
# The second tab, 'Positions', is where we place the payload position pointer, 
# which is the point where words from our wordlist will be placed and iterated over. 
# We will be demonstrating how to fuzz web directories, which is similar to what's done by tools like ffuf or gobuster.

# To check whether a web directory exists, our fuzzing should be in 'GET /DIRECTORY/', 
# such that existing pages would return 200 OK, otherwise we'd get 404 NOT FOUND. 
# So, we will need to select DIRECTORY as the payload position, by either wrapping it with § or by selecting the word DIRECTORY 
# and clicking on the Add § button.
```

```
# Tip: the DIRECTORY in this case is the pointer's name, which can be anything, and can be used to refer to each pointer, 
# in case we are using more than position with different wordlists for each.
```

[attack-type](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/intruder/configure-attack/positions#attack-type)

```
# The final thing to select in the target tab is the Attack Type. 
# The attack type defines how many payload pointers are used and determines which payload is assigned to which position. 
# For simplicity, we'll stick to the first type, Sniper, which uses only one position. 
# Try clicking on the ? at the top of the window to read more about attack types, or check out the link above.
```

```
# Note: Be sure to leave the extra two lines at the end of the request, otherwise we may get an error response from the server.
```

### Payloads

```
# On the third tab, 'Payloads', we get to choose and customize our payloads/wordlists. 
# This payload/wordlist is what would be iterated over, and each element/line of it would be placed 
# and tested one by one in the Payload Position we chose earlier. 
# There are four main things we need to configure:

- Payload Sets
- Payload Options
- Payload Processing
- Payload Encoding
```

### Payload Sets

```
# The first thing we must configure is the Payload Set. The payload set identifies the Payload number, 
# depending on the attack type and number of Payloads we used in the Payload Position Pointers:
```

```
# Next, we need to select the Payload Type, which is the type of payloads/wordlists we will be using. 
# Burp provides a variety of Payload Types, each of which acts in a certain way. 
# For example:

- Simple List: The basic and most fundamental type. We provide a wordlist, and Intruder iterates over each line in it.
- Runtime file: Similar to Simple List, but loads line-by-line as the scan runs to avoid excessive memory usage by Burp.
- Character Substitution: Lets us specify a list of characters and their replacements, and Burp Intruder tries all potential permutations.
```

### Payload Options

```
# Next, we must specify the Payload Options, which is different for each Payload Type we select in Payload Sets. 
# For a Simple List, we have to create or load a wordlist. 
# To do so, we can input each item manually by clicking Add, which would build our wordlist on the fly. 
# The other more common option is to click on Load, and then select a file to load into Burp Intruder.

# We will select /<path>/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt as our wordlist. 
# We can see that Burp Intruder loads all lines of our wordlist into the Payload Options table.
```

### Payload Processing

```
# Another option we can apply is Payload Processing, which allows us to determine fuzzing rules over the loaded wordlist. 
# For example, if we wanted to add an extension after our payload item, or if we wanted to filter the wordlist based on specific criteria, 
# we can do so with payload processing.

# We can do that by clicking on the Add button and then selecting Skip if matches regex, 
# which allows us to provide a regex pattern for items we want to skip. 
# Then, we can provide a regex pattern that matches lines starting with ., which is: ^\..*$
```

### Options

```
# Another useful option is the Grep - Match, which enables us to flag specific requests depending on their responses. 
# As we are fuzzing web directories, we are only interested in responses with HTTP code 200 OK. 
# So, we'll first enable it and then click Clear to clear the current list. 
# After that, we can type 200 OK to match any requests with this string and click Add to add the new rule. 
```

### Task Solution

```
# Address and port from task: 83.136.255.243:40634/admin/
# Modify request like: GET /admin/§flag§.html HTTP/1.1
# Payload: Simple List
# Load file common.txt like in guide from:

https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt

# Add Grep - Match: 200 OK in OPTIONS.
# Start Sniper attack

# Flag in GET /admin/2010.html file
```


### ZAP fuzzers

```
# Pretty similar for Burp, but useless to descripbe only with by text description, 
# so awarness info will be in task case.

```


### Task solution

```
# Target(s): 94.237.59.180:43393

# Task:
# The directory we found above sets the cookie to the md5 hash of the username, 
# as we can see the md5 cookie in the request for the (guest) user. 

# Visit '/skills/' to get a request with a cookie, then try to use ZAP Fuzzer to fuzz the cookie 
# for different md5 hashed usernames to get the flag. 

# Use the "top-usernames-shortlist.txt" wordlist from Seclists.

# Solution:
# Go to 94.237.59.180:43393/skills
# Click on last Request-Response with cookie and "Fuzz..." (choose right req-res, check for cookie when starting fuzz tool!)
# Next highlight cookie and click add, next again add and use file /SecLists/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt and add again.
# Next click on processors, add, choose MD5 Hash, check preview, remember part of encoded value for "user" because it's mentioned in task.
# OK, OK, Start Fuzzer
# Next you can Sort requests by size, and max size - 450 bytes will be exactly for "user".
# Click on it and in Response you'll see html with flag below "Welcome Back user".
