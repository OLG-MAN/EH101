### Types of Reconnaissance

#### Active Reconnaissance

```
# Technique                         # Tools (and Risk)
- Port Scanning                     Nmap, Masscan, Unicornscan  (High (IDS))
- Vulnerability Scanning            Nessus, OpenVAS, Nikto      (High)
- Network Mapping                   Traceroute, Nmap            (Medium to High) 
- Banner Grabbing                   Netcat, curl                (Low)
- OS Fingerprinting                 Nmap, Xprobe2               (Low)
- Service Enumeration               Nmap                        (Low)
- Web Spidering                     Burp Suite Spider, OWASP ZAP Spider, Scrapy  (Low to Medium)
```

#### Passive Reconnaissance

```
# Technique                         # Tools
- Search Engine Queries             Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing, specialised search engines (e.g.Shodan)  (Very Low)
- WHOIS Lookups                     whois command-line tool, online WHOIS lookup services              (Very Low)
- DNS                               dig, nslookup, host, dnsenum, fierce, dnsrecon                     (Very Low)
- Web Archive Analysis              Wayback Machine                                                    (Very Low)
- Social Media Analysis             LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, specialised OSINT tools               (Very Low)
- Code Repositories                 GitHub, GitLab                                                     (Very Low)

### WHOIS ###

```
# WHOIS is a widely used query and response protocol designed to access databases that store information about registered internet resources.
# Primarily associated with domain names, WHOIS can also provide details about IP address blocks and autonomous systems.

Each WHOIS record typically contains the following information:

Domain Name:              The domain name itself (e.g., example.com)
Registrar:                The company where the domain was registered (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap)
Registrant Contact:       The person or organization that registered the domain.
Administrative Contact:   The person responsible for managing the domain.
Technical Contact:        The person handling technical issues related to the domain.
Creation and Expiration Dates: When the domain was registered and when it's set to expire.
Name Servers:             Servers that translate the domain name into an IP address.

WHOIS data serves as a treasure trove of information for penetration testers during the reconnaissance phase of an assessment.

### Utilising WHOIS

```
Scenario 1: Phishing Investigation

The WHOIS record reveals the following:
- Registration Date:  The domain was registered just a few days ago.
- Registrant:         The registrant's information is hidden behind a privacy service.
- Name Servers:       The name servers are associated with a known bulletproof hosting provider often used for malicious activities.


Scenario 2: Malware Analysis

The WHOIS record reveals:
- Registrant:    The domain is registered to an individual using a free email service known for anonymity.
- Location:      The registrant's address is in a country with a high prevalence of cybercrime.
- Registrar:     The domain was registered through a registrar with a history of lax abuse policies.


Scenario 3: Threat Intelligence Report

By analysing the WHOIS records, analysts uncover the following patterns:
- Registration Dates: The domains were registered in clusters, often shortly before major attacks.
- Registrants: The registrants use various aliases and fake identities.
- Name Servers: The domains often share the same name servers, suggesting a common infrastructure.
- Takedown History: Many domains have been taken down after attacks, indicating previous law enforcement or security interventions.
