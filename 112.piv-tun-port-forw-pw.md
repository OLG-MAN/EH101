### Dynamic Port Forwarding with SSH and SOCKS Tunneling

```
# Port forwarding is a technique that allows us to redirect a communication request from one port to another. 
# Port forwarding uses TCP as the primary communication layer to provide interactive communication for the forwarded port. 
# However, different application layer protocols such as SSH or even SOCKS (non-application layer) 
# can be used to encapsulate the forwarded traffic. 
# This can be effective in bypassing firewalls and using existing services on your compromised host to pivot to other networks.
```

![PF01](./pf01.webp "Port Forwarding")

```
# We have our attack host (10.10.15.x) and a target Ubuntu server (10.129.x.x), which we have compromised. 
# We will scan the target Ubuntu server using Nmap to search for open ports.

nmap -sT -p22,3306 10.129.202.64
```

```
# The Nmap output shows that the SSH port is open. 
# To access the MySQL service, we can either SSH into the server and access MySQL from inside the Ubuntu server, 
# or we can port forward it to our localhost on port 1234 and access it locally. 
# A benefit of accessing it locally is if we want to execute a remote exploit on the MySQL service, 
# we won't be able to do it without port forwarding. 
# This is due to MySQL being hosted locally on the Ubuntu server on port 3306. 
# So, we will use the below command to forward our local port (1234) over SSH to the Ubuntu server

ssh -L 1234:localhost:3306 ubuntu@10.129.202.64  
```

```
# The -L command tells the SSH client to request the SSH server to forward all the data we send 
# via the port 1234 to localhost:3306 on the Ubuntu server. 
# By doing this, we should be able to access the MySQL service locally on port 1234. 
# We can use Netstat or Nmap to query our local host on 1234 port to verify whether the MySQL service was forwarded.

netstat -antp | grep 1234   

nmap -v -sV -p1234 localhost        # Confirming Port Forward with Nmap
```

```
# Similarly, if we want to forward multiple ports from the Ubuntu server to your localhost, 
# you can do so by including the local port:server:port argument to your ssh command. 
# For example, the below command forwards the apache web server's port 80 to your attack host's local port on 8080.

ssh -L 1234:localhost:3306 -L 8080:localhost:80 ubuntu@10.129.202.64
```

### Setting up to Pivot

```
# Now, if you type ifconfig on the Ubuntu host, you will find that this server has multiple NICs:

- One connected to our attack host (ens192)
- One communicating to other hosts within a different network (ens224)
- The loopback interface (lo).
```

```
# Unlike the previous scenario where we knew which port to access, in our current scenario, 
# we don't know which services lie on the other side of the network. 
# So, we can scan smaller ranges of IPs on the network (172.16.5.1-200) network or the entire subnet (172.16.5.0/23). 
# We cannot perform this scan directly from our attack host because it does not have routes to the 172.16.5.0/23 network.
# To do this, we will have to perform dynamic port forwarding and pivot our network packets via the Ubuntu server. 
```

![PF01](./pivot01.webp "Pivot setup")


```
# This is called SSH tunneling over SOCKS proxy. 
# SOCKS stands for Socket Secure, a protocol that helps communicate with servers where you have firewall restrictions in place.
# This technique is often used to circumvent the restrictions put in place by firewalls, 
# and allow an external entity to bypass the firewall and access a service within the firewalled environment.
```

```
# One more benefit of using SOCKS proxy for pivoting and forwarding data is 
# that SOCKS proxies can pivot via creating a route to an external server from NAT networks. 
# SOCKS proxies are currently of two types: SOCKS4 and SOCKS5. 
# SOCKS4 doesn't provide any authentication and UDP support, whereas SOCKS5 does provide that. 
# Let's take an example of the below image where we have a NAT'd network of 172.16.5.0/23, which we cannot access directly.
```

![PF01](./pivot02.webp "Pivot 2")

```
# The attack host starts the SSH client and requests the SSH server to allow it to send some TCP data over the ssh socket. 
# The SSH server responds with an acknowledgment, and the SSH client then starts listening on localhost:9050. 
# Whatever data you send here will be broadcasted to the entire network (172.16.5.0/23) over SSH.

ssh -D 9050 ubuntu@10.129.202.64       # Enabling Dynamic Port Forwarding with SSH

# The -D argument requests the SSH server to enable dynamic port forwarding. 
# Once we have this enabled, we will require a tool that can route any tool's packets over the port 9050. 
# We can do this using the tool proxychains, which is capable of redirecting TCP connections through 
# TOR, SOCKS, and HTTP/HTTPS proxy servers and also allows us to chain multiple proxy servers together. 
```

```
# To inform proxychains that we must use port 9050, we must modify the proxychains configuration file 
# located at /etc/proxychains.conf. We can add socks4 127.0.0.1 9050 to the last line if it is not already there.

tail -4 /etc/proxychains.conf
```

```
# Now when you start Nmap with proxychains using the below command, 
# it will route all the packets of Nmap to the local port 9050, 
# where our SSH client is listening, which will forward all the packets over SSH to the 172.16.5.0/23 network.

proxychains nmap -v -sn 172.16.5.1-200          # scan part of target network

# This part of packing all your Nmap data using proxychains and forwarding it to a remote server is called SOCKS tunneling. 
# One more important note to remember here is that we can only perform a full TCP connect scan over proxychains. 
# The reason for this is that proxychains cannot understand partial packets. 
# If you send partial packets like half connect scans, it will return incorrect results. 
# We also need to make sure we are aware of the fact that host-alive checks may not work against Windows targets 
# because the Windows Defender firewall blocks ICMP requests (traditional pings) by default.

# A full TCP connect scan without ping on an entire network range will take a long time. 
# So, for this module, we will primarily focus on scanning individual hosts, or smaller ranges of hosts we know are alive, 
# which in this case will be a Windows host at 172.16.5.19.

proxychains nmap -v -Pn -sT 172.16.5.19           # Enumerating the Windows Target through Proxychains
```

```
# Similar to the Nmap scan, we can also pivot msfconsole via proxychains to perform vulnerable RDP scans 
# using Metasploit auxiliary modules. We can start msfconsole with proxychains.

proxychains msfconsole

# Let's use the rdp_scanner auxiliary module to check if the host on the internal network is listening on 3389.

msf6 > search rdp_scanner
msf6 > use 0
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/rdp/rdp_scanner) > set rhosts 172.16.5.19
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/rdp/rdp_scanner) > run
```

```
# Depending on the level of access we have to this host during an assessment, 
# we may try to run an exploit or log in using gathered credentials. 
# For this module, we will log in to the Windows remote host over the SOCKS tunnel. 
# This can be done using xfreerdp. The user in our case is victor, and the password is pass@123

proxychains xfreerdp /v:172.16.5.19 /u:victor /p:pass@123
```

# Task solution

```
10.129.230.216

SSH to 10.129.230.216 (ACADEMY-PIVOTING-LINUXPIV) with user "ubuntu" and password "HTB_@cademy_stdnt!" 

ssh ubuntu@10.129.230.216        # login + pass
ip a                             # count NIC's

tail -4 /etc/proxychains.conf         # Double check configs on PenTest host
ssh -D 9050 ubuntu@10.129.230.216     # Create pivot host (you'll login inside)

proxychains xfreerdp /v:172.16.5.19 /u:victor /p:pass@123  # Open second terminal session on PenTest host login by RDP and ctf
(You'll see that xfreerdp working over SOCKS proxy)
