### Infiltrating Unix/Linux

[OS Web](https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/operating_system)

```
# According to study reports above over 86% of websites (webservers) run on a Unix-based system. 
# For us, this means we can significantly benefit from continuing to grow our knowledge of Unix/Linux 
# and how we can gain shell sessions on these environments to potentially pivot further within an environment. 

# While it is common for organizations to use 3rd parties & cloud providers to host their websites & web apps, 
# many organizations still host their websites & web applications on servers in their network environments (on-prem). 
# In these cases, we would want to establish a shell session with the underlying system 
# to attempt to pivot to other systems on the internal network.
```

### Common Considerations

```
# When considering how we will establish a shell session on a Unix/Linux system, we will benefit from considering the following:

- What distribution of Linux is the system running?
- What shell & programming languages exist on the system?
- What function is the system serving for the network environment it is on?
- What application is the system hosting?
- Are there any known vulnerabilities?
```

### Gaining a Shell Through Attacking a Vulnerable Application

```
# As in most engagements, we will start with an initial enumeration of the system using Nmap.:

nmap -sC -sV 10.129.201.101              # Scan with basic script and service versions on each available port

# What information could we gather from the output?
# onsidering we can see the system is listening on ports 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 3306 (MySQL), and 21 (FTP), 
# it may be safe to assume that this is a web server hosting a web application. 
# We can also see some version numbers revealed associated with the web stack (Apache 2.4.6 and PHP 7.2.34 ) 
# and the distribution of Linux running on the system (CentOS).

# We also con simply try to access by IP and the website/webservie there. And we found that it's rConfig tool.
# Next we'll google vulns for particular version of this tool what we saw on website it's 3.9.6
```

```
# Search For an Exploit Module

msf6 > search rconfig                # seraching for rtool vuln with msfconsole

# One detail that can be overlooked when relying on MSF to find an exploit module for a specific application is the version of MSF. 
# There may be useful exploit modules that are not installed on our system or just aren't showing up via search. 
# In these cases, it's good to know that Rapid 7 keeps code for exploit modules in their repos on github.
```
[MSF GitHub repo](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/tree/master/modules/exploits)

```
# This search can point us to the source code for an exploit module called rconfig_vendors_auth_file_upload_rce.rb. 
# We can copy the code from this repo onto our local attack box and save it in the directory that our local install of MSF is referencing.

locate exploits          # Locate exploits folder 
output:
/usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules/exploits

# We can copy the code into a file and save it in /usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules/exploits/linux/http 
# similar to where they are storing the code in the GitHub repo.
```

```

### Spawning Interactive Shells

```
# Initially, our shell was limited (sometimes referred to as a jail shell), 
# so we used python to spawn a TTY bourne shell to give us access to more commands and a prompt to work from. 

# Know that whenever we see /bin/sh or /bin/bash, this could also be replaced with the binary associated with 
# the shell interpreter language present on that system. 
# With most Linux systems, we will likely come across bourne shell (/bin/sh) and bourne again shell (/bin/bash) present on the system natively.
