### Payloads

```
# A Payload in Metasploit refers to a module that aids the exploit module in (typically) returning a shell to the attacker. 
# The payloads are sent together with the exploit itself to bypass standard functioning procedures of the vulnerable service 
# (exploits job) and then run on the target OS to typically return a reverse connection to the attacker and establish a foothold (payload's job).

# There are three different types of payload modules in the Metasploit Framework: Singles, Stagers, and Stages.
# Whether or not a payload is staged is represented by / in the payload name.
# For example, windows/shell_bind_tcp is a single payload with no stage, 
# whereas windows/shell/bind_tcp consists of a stager (bind_tcp) and a stage (shell).

- A Single payload contains the exploit and the entire shellcode for the selected task. 
# Inline payloads are by design more stable than their counterparts because they contain everything all-in-one. 
# However, some exploits will not support the resulting size of these payloads as they can get quite large. 
# Singles are self-contained payloads. 

- Stager payloads work with Stage payloads to perform a specific task. 
# A Stager is waiting on the attacker machine, ready to establish a connection to the victim host once the stage completes its run on the remote host.
# Stagers are typically used to set up a network connection between the attacker and victim and are designed to be small and reliable.

- Stages are payload components that are downloaded by stager's modules. 
# The various payload Stages provide advanced features with no size limits, such as Meterpreter, VNC Injection, and others.

# Stage0 of a staged payload represents the initial shellcode sent over the network to the target machine's vulnerable service, 
# which has the sole purpose of initializing a connection back to the attacker machine. 
# This is what is known as a reverse connection. (reverse_tcp, reverse_https, and bind_tcp)
```

### Meterpreter Payload

```
# The Meterpreter payload is a specific type of multi-faceted payload that uses DLL injection to ensure the connection to the victim host is stable, 
# hard to detect by simple checks, and persistent across reboots or system changes.

# Meterpreter resides completely in the memory of the remote host and leaves no traces on the hard drive, 
# making it very difficult to detect with conventional forensic techniques. 
# In addition, scripts and plugins can be loaded and unloaded dynamically as required.

# It is very similar to the msfconsole interface, but all available commands are aimed at the target system, which the payload has "infected.
# It offers us a plethora of useful commands, varying from keystroke capture, password hash collection, 
# microphone tapping, and screenshotting to impersonating process security tokens.
```

### Searching for Payloads

```
# To select our first payload, we need to know what we want to do on the target machine. 
# For example, if we are going for access persistence, we will probably want to select a Meterpreter payload.
# As mentioned above, Meterpreter payloads offer us a significant amount of flexibility.

# Note:
# For the Exploit part, we will need to set the following:
RHOSTS	  The IP address of the remote host, the target machine.
RPORT	    Does not require a change, just a check that we are on port 445, where SMB is running.

For the payload part, we will need to set the following:
LHOST	    The host's IP address, the attacker's machine.
LPORT	    Does not require a change, just a check that the port is not already in use.
