### Basic Strategies, check host liveness
```
nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -sn -oA tnet | grep for | cut -d" " -f5   # enumerate/recon existing hosts in network range without port scanning (ARP ping)
nmap -sn -oA tnet -iL hosts.lst | grep for | cut -d" " -f5   # enunarate active hosts from list of existing (other ignore ICMP request)

sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet 10.129.2.18 10.129.2.19 10.129.2.20 | grep for | cut -d" " -f5  # check small range of hosts
sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet 10.129.2.18-20 | grep for | cut -d" " -f5   # the same but with respective octet range

sudo nmap 10.129.163.179 -sn -oA host   # check target       # check on host target without port scanning (ICMP only)
sudo nmap 10.129.163.179 -sn -oA host -PE --packet-trace     # check host with packet-trace (ARP ping)
sudo nmap 10.129.163.179 -sn -oA host -PE --reason           # another way to determine live host (ARP ping)
sudo nmap 10.129.163.179 -sn -oA host -PE --packet-trace --disable-arp-ping  # way to check with disabled ARP ping (ICMP)

```

### Scanned port states

```
There are a total of 6 different states for a scanned port we can obtain:

open    
# This indicates that the connection to the scanned port has been established. These connections can be TCP connections, UDP datagrams as well as SCTP associations.

closed  
# When the port is shown as closed, the TCP protocol indicates that the packet we received back contains an RST flag. This scanning method can also be used to determine if our target is alive or not.

filtered  
# Nmap cannot correctly identify whether the scanned port is open or closed because either no response is returned from the target for the port or we get an error code from the target.

unfiltered	
# This state of a port only occurs during the TCP-ACK scan and means that the port is accessible, but it cannot be determined whether it is open or closed.

open|filtered	
# If we do not get a response for a specific port, Nmap will set it to that state. This indicates that a firewall or packet filter may protect the port.

closed|filtered	 
# This state only occurs in the IP ID idle scans and indicates that it was impossible to determine if the scanned port is closed or filtered by a firewall.
```
  
### Port scanning
```
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 --top-ports=10            # scan top-10 (default top 100) ports on target machine
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 21 --packet-trace -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping       # Scan only 21 prot without DNS and ARP to have a clear view of the SYN scan.
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 443 --packet-trace --disable-arp-ping -Pn -n --reason -sT    # "Connect scan" on TCP 443 port
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 139 --packet-trace -n --disable-arp-ping -Pn      # check drop packet traffic flow (firewall) with disabled ICMP, ARP, DNS  (??)
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 445 --packet-trace -n --disable-arp-ping -Pn      # check samba, and see that port cover by firewall (exist, open but cover)
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -F -sU     # check open UDP ports again top 100 ports
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -sU -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace -p 137 --reason    # another UDP check (no response UDP issue)
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -sU -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace -p 100 --reason    # getting error code=3 to determine that port definitely unreachable
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -sU -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace -p 138 --reason    # open|filtered ICMP response    
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace -p 445 --reason -sV    # handy showing service version on ports

``` 

### NMAP output
```
Normal output (-oN) with the .nmap file extension
Grepable output (-oG) with the .gnmap file extension
XML output (-oX) with the .xml file extension
We can also specify the option (-oA) to save the results in all formats. 
```

```
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p- -oA target    # all ports scan with saved output in all extensions in current directory
xsltproc target.xml -o target.html      # XML output can create easy to read HTML reports with tool xsltproc
```

### Service enumeration
```
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p- -sV                               # Enumerate ports with services and their versions.
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p- -sV --stats-every=5s              # Show enum statsu every 5 sec (for long scan)
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p- -sV -v                            # increase verbosity level, show ports what namp detect in real-time
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 80 -sV -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace    # check packets in case of nmap can't recognize service by prev scans,
                                                                            # in this command DNS/ARP/ICMP pings are disabled but tracing packets
# Approach to grab, intercept additional info missed by nmap
# E.g by prev command above we see `10.129.2.28:25 is smtp` mention in net packets
# So we can use `nc` to connect and `tcpdump` to catch needed info(2 terminals)
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 host 10.10.14.2 and 10.129.2.28
nc -nv 10.129.2.28 25

```

### Nmap scripting engine
```
# script details
auth	         # Determination of authentication credentials.
broadcast	     # Scripts, which are used for host discovery by broadcasting and the discovered hosts, can be automatically added to the remaining scans.
brute	         # Executes scripts that try to log in to the respective service by brute-forcing with credentials.
default	         # Default scripts executed by using the -sC option.
discovery	     # Evaluation of accessible services.
dos	             # These scripts are used to check services for denial of service vulnerabilities and are used less as it harms the services.
exploit	         # This category of scripts tries to exploit known vulnerabilities for the scanned port.
external	     # Scripts that use external services for further processing.
fuzzer	         # This uses scripts to identify vulnerabilities and unexpected packet handling by sending different fields, which can take much time.
intrusive	     # Intrusive scripts that could negatively affect the target system.
malware	         # Checks if some malware infects the target system.
safe	         # Defensive scripts that do not perform intrusive and destructive access.
version	         # Extension for service detection.
vuln	         # Identification of specific vulnerabilities.

# sceleton for defining script in nmap command:
sudo nmap <target> -sC                                       # defaule script
sudo nmap <target> --script <category>                       # specific sript category
sudo nmap <target> --script <script-name>,<script-name>,...  # defined scripts 

# example 
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 25 --script banner,smtp-commands    # working with the target SMTP port
 
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 80 -A    # Aggressive scan, Performs service detection, OS detection, traceroute and uses defaults scripts to scan the target.
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 80 -sV --script vuln     # Perform scan on port 80 and realted possible vulns on it.(!)

```

sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F --max-retries 0 | grep "/tcp" | wc -l                 # 21 ports, accelerating can also have a negative effect on our results

# In case of white pentest with knowing network ranges etc.
sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F -oN tnet.default                                      # defult number of packets per second, scanned in 29.83 seconds

```

### Firewall and IDS/IPS Evasion
```
# "filtered" port hadling by firewall can `dropped` or `rejected` or ping packets with ICMP errors like:
Net    # Unreachable
Net    # Prohibited
Host   # Unreachable
Host   # Prohibited
Port   # Unreachable
Proto  # Unreachable
-sS	   # Performs SYN scan on specified ports.
-sA	   # Performs ACK scan on specified ports.


sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 21,22,25 -sS -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace      # scan with regular SYN packets, usually bloaking by firewall
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 21,22,25 -sA -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace      # ACK scan method, much harder to filter for firewalls and IDS/IPS systems

-D RND:5   # Generates five random IP addresses that indicates the source IP the connection comes from. (Decoys must be alive, preventing SYN flood detect)
-O	       # Performs operation system detection scan.
-S	       # Scans the target by using different source IP address.
-e         # tun0 Sends all requests through the specified interface.

sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 80 -sS -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace -D RND:5   # scan with 5 randon decoys IP (with your real inside)
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -n -Pn -p445 -O                                               # Testing Firewall Rule
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -n -Pn -p 445 -O -S 10.129.2.200 -e tun0                      # Scan by Using Different Source IP

```

### DNS Proxying
```
--source-port 53	# Performs the scans from specified source port.

sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p50000 -sS -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace                    # SYN-Scan of a Filtered Port (50000/tcp filtered ibm-db2)
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p50000 -sS -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace --source-port 53   # SYN-Scan From DNS Port (50000/tcp open  ibm-db2)
sudo ncat -nv --source-port 53 10.129.2.28 50000                     # Connect To The Filtered Port  (Ncat: Connected to 10.129.2.28:50000, 220 ProFTPd)

sudo nmap 10.129.89.45 -v -sV -p- -n --min-rate 5000 --disable-arp-ping --source-port 53      # Handy scan options from hard lab
