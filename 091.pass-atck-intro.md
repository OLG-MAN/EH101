### Theory of Protection

```
# Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are at the heart of every Infosec practitioner's role. 

# Authentication, at its core, is the validation of your identity by presenting a combination of three main factors to a validation mechanism. They are;

- Something you know (a password, passcode, pin, etc.).
- Something you have (an ID Card, security key, or other MFA tools).
- Something you are (your physical self, username, email address, or other identifiers.)
```

```
# A password or passphrase can be generally defined as a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols in a string for identity validation. 
# For example, if we work with passwords and take a standard 8-digit password that consists only of upper case letters and numbers, 
# we would get a total of 36‚Å∏ (208,827,064,576) different combinations of passwords.

# Realistically, it doesn't need to be a combination of those things. 
# It could be a lyric from a song or poem, a line from a book, a phrase you can remember, 
# or even randomly generated words concatenated together like "TreeDogEvilElephant."

### Credential Storage

```
# Every application that supports authentication mechanisms compares the given entries/credentials with local or remote databases. 
# In the case of local databases, these credentials are stored locally on the system. 
# Web applications are often vulnerable to SQL injections, 
# which can lead to the worst-case scenario where the attackers view the entirety of an organization's data in plain text.

# RockYou txt
# This list includes about 14 million unique passwords, and it was created after a data breach of the company RockYou, 
# which contained a total of 32 million user accounts. 
```

### Linux Authentication

```
# As we already know, Linux-based systems handle everything in the form of a file.
# Accordingly, passwords are also stored encrypted in a file.
# This file is called the shadow file and is located in /etc/shadow and is part of the Linux user management system.
# In addition, these passwords are commonly stored in the form of hashes. An example can look like this:

cat /etc/shadow
output:
...
user:$y$j9T$3QSBB6CbHEu...f8Ms:18955:0:99999:7:::

# The /etc/shadow file has a unique format in which the entries are entered and saved when new users are created.

user:	      $y$j9T$3...f8Ms:	     18955:                 0:          99999:     7:                  :                    :                    :
<username>:	  <encrypted password>:  <day of last change>:  <min age>:  <max age>: <warning period>:  <inactivity period>: <expiration date>:	<reserved field>

# The encryption of the password in this file is formatted as follows:

$ <id>  $ <salt>    $ <hashed>
$ y     $ j9T       $ 3QSBB6CbHEu...f8Ms

# The type (id) is the cryptographic hash method used to encrypt the password. Many different cryptographic hash methods were used in the past and are still used by some systems today.

ID         Cryptographic Hash Algorithm
$1$        MD5
$2a$       Blowfish
$5$        SHA-256
$6$        SHA-512
$sha1$     SHA1crypt
$y$        Yescrypt
$gy$       Gost-yescrypt
$7$        Scrypt
```

```
# However, a few more files belong to the user management system of Linux. The other two files are /etc/passwd and /etc/group.

cat /etc/passwd
output:
user:x:1000:1000:,,,:/home/htb-student:/bin/bash

# Description:
htb-student:   x:           1000:   1000:   ,,,:         /home/htb-student:   /bin/bash
<username>:    <password>:  <uid>:  <gid>:  <comment>:   <home directory>:    <cmd executed after logging in>

# The x in the password field indicates that the encrypted password is in the /etc/shadow file.

#### Windows Authentication Process

[Diagram](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/147/Auth_process1.png)

```
# Local interactive logon is performed by the interaction between the logon process (WinLogon), 
# the logon user interface process (LogonUI), the credential providers, 
# LSASS, one or more authentication packages, and SAM or Active Directory. 
# Authentication packages, in this case, are the Dynamic-Link Libraries (DLLs) that perform authentication checks. 
# For example, for non-domain joined and interactive logins, the authentication package Msv1_0.dll is used.
```

```
# LSASS

# Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) is a collection of many modules 
# and has access to all authentication processes that can be found in %SystemRoot%\System32\Lsass.exe. 
# This service is responsible for the local system security policy, user authentication, and sending security audit logs to the Event log. 

# Auth Packages	  Description
Lsasrv.dll        The LSA Server service both enforces security policies and acts as the security package manager for the LSA. 
Msv1_0.dll        Authentication package for local machine logons that don't require custom authentication.
Samsrv.dll        The Security Accounts Manager (SAM) stores local security accounts, enforces locally stored policies, and supports APIs.
Kerberos.dll      Security package loaded by the LSA for Kerberos-based authentication on a machine.
Netlogon.dll      Network-based logon service.
Ntdsa.dll         This library is used to create new records and folders in the Windows registry.
```

[Microsoft Docs.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/windows-authentication/credentials-processes-in-windows-authentication)

```
# The Security Account Manager (SAM) is a database file in Windows operating systems that stores users' passwords. 
# It can be used to authenticate local and remote users. 
# SAM uses cryptographic measures to prevent unauthenticated users from accessing the system. 
# User passwords are stored in a hash format in a registry structure as either an LM hash or an NTLM hash. 
# This file is located in %SystemRoot%/system32/config/SAM and is mounted on HKLM/SAM. 
# SYSTEM level permissions are required to view it.
