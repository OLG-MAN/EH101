### Detection & Prevention

[MITRE ATT&CK Framework](https://attack.mitre.org/)

```
# When it comes to looking for and identifying active shells, payload delivery and execution, 
# and potential attempts to subvert our defenses, we have many different options to utilize to detect and respond to these events.

# Let's take a second to talk about the MITRE ATT&CK Framework and define the techniques and tactics being utilized by attackers.
# The ATT&CK Framework as defined by MITRE, 
# is "a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations."

# Keeping the framework in mind, three of the most notable techniques we can tie to Shells & Payloads are listed below in the table with descriptions.
# Notable MITRE ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques:
```

- [Initial Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/)
- [Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0002)
- [Command & Control](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0011)

### Events To Watch For:

```
- File uploads: 
# Especially with Web Applications, file uploads are a common method of acquiring a shell on a host 
# besides direct command execution in the browser. 
# Pay attention to application logs to determine if anyone has uploaded anything potentially malicious.

- Suspicious non-admin user actions:
# Looking for simple things like normal users issuing commands via Bash or cmd can be a significant indicator of compromise. 
# When was the last time an average user, much less an admin, had to issue the command whoami on a host?

- Anomalous network sessions:
# Users tend to have a pattern they follow for network interaction. 
# They visit the same websites, use the same applications, and often perform those actions multiple times a day like clockwork. 
# Logging and parsing NetFlow data can be a great way to spot anomalous network traffic. 

# Looking at things such as top talkers, or unique site visits, 
# watching for a heartbeat on a nonstandard port (like 4444, the default port used by Meterpreter), 
# and monitoring any remote login attempts or bulk GET / POST requests 
# in short amounts of time can all be indicators of compromise or attempted exploitation.
```

### Establish Network Visibility

```
# Much like identifying and then using various shells & payloads, detection & prevention requires 
# a detailed understanding of the systems and overall network environment you are trying to protect. 
# It's always essential to have good documentation practices so individuals responsible 
# for keeping the environment secure can have consistent visibility of the devices, data, and traffic flow in the environments they administer.

# Developing & maintaining visual network topology diagrams can help visualize network traffic flow. 
# Newer tools like netbrain may be good to research as they combine visual diagraming that can be achieved with tools like Draw.io, 
# documentation and remote management.

[Draw.io](https://draw.io/)

```
# Some network device vendors like Cisco Meraki, Ubiquiti, Check Point, and Palo Alto Networks 
# are building layer 7 visibility (like layer 7 of the OSI model) into their network devices 
# and moving the management capabilities to cloud-based network controllers. 

# A visual dashboard is often provided with these cloud-based network controllers making 
# it easier to have a baseline of the traffic usage, network protocols, applications, and inbound & outbound traffic.

# Having a network security appliance capable of deep packet inspection (with SurfShark etc.) can often act as an anti-virus for the network.

### Protecting End Devices

```
# End devices are the devices that connect at the "end" of a network. 
# This means they are either the source or destination of data transmission. 
# Some examples of end devices would be:

- Workstations (employees computers)
- Servers (providing various services on the network)
- Printers
- Network Attached Storage (NAS)
- Cameras
- Smart TVs
-  Smart Speakers
```

### Potential Mitigations

```
- Application Sandboxing: 
# By sandboxing your applications that are exposed to the world, 
# you can limit the scope of access and damage an attacker can perform 
# if they find a vulnerability or misconfiguration in the application.

- Least Privilege Permission Policies: 
# Limiting the permissions users have can go a long way to help stop unauthorized access or compromise.

- Host Segmentation & Hardening: 
# Properly hardening hosts and segregating any hosts that require exposure to the internet can help ensure an attacker cannot easily hop in 
# and move laterally into your network if they gain access to a boundary host. 
# Following STIG hardening guides and placing hosts such as web servers, VPN servers, etc., 
# in a DMZ or 'quarantine' network segment will stop that type of access and lateral movement.

- Physical and Application Layer Firewalls: 
# Firewalls can be powerful tools if appropriately implemented. 
# Proper inbound and outbound rules that only allow traffic first established from within your network, on ports approved for your applications, 
# and denying inbound traffic from your network addresses or other prohibited IP space can cripple many bind and reverse shells.
