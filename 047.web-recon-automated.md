### Automating Recon

```
# Why Automate Reconnaissance?
- Efficiency: 
Automated tools can perform repetitive tasks much faster than humans, freeing up valuable time for analysis and decision-making.

 - Scalability: 
 Automation allows you to scale your reconnaissance efforts across a large number of targets or domains, uncovering a broader scope of information.

- Consistency: 
Automated tools follow predefined rules and procedures, ensuring consistent and reproducible results and minimising the risk of human error.

- Comprehensive Coverage: 
Automation can be programmed to perform a wide range of reconnaissance tasks, including DNS enumeration, 
subdomain discovery, web crawling, port scanning, and more, ensuring thorough coverage of potential attack vectors.

- Integration: 
Many automation frameworks allow for easy integration with other tools and platforms, 
creating a seamless workflow from reconnaissance to vulnerability assessment and exploitation.

### Reconnaissance Frameworks

[FinalRecon](https://github.com/thewhiteh4t/FinalRecon)
```
# A Python-based reconnaissance tool offering a range of modules for different tasks like 
# SSL certificate checking, Whois information gathering, header analysis, and crawling. 
# Its modular structure enables easy customisation for specific needs.
```

[Recon-ng](https://github.com/lanmaster53/recon-ng)
```
# A powerful framework written in Python that offers a modular structure with various modules for different reconnaissance tasks. 
# It can perform DNS enumeration, subdomain discovery, port scanning, web crawling, and even exploit known vulnerabilities.
```

[theHarvester](https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester)
```
# Specifically designed for gathering email addresses, subdomains, hosts, employee names, open ports, and banners 
# from different public sources like search engines, PGP key servers, and the SHODAN database. 
# It is a command-line tool written in Python.
```

[SpiderFoot](https://github.com/smicallef/spiderfoot)
```
# An open-source intelligence automation tool that integrates with various data sources to collect information about a target, 
# including IP addresses, domain names, email addresses, and social media profiles. 
# It can perform DNS lookups, web crawling, port scanning, and more.
```

[OSINT Framework](https://osintframework.com/)
```
# A collection of various tools and resources for open-source intelligence gathering. 
# It covers a wide range of information sources, including social media, search engines, public records, and more.
```

### Module summary 

```(TODO, WIP)
# All Tools in module due to their scopes and recon layer from high to deep:

domain:               whois, dig, certs(crt.sh API)
domain-host-enum:     dnsenum, gobuster
host-fingerprint:     
domain-host-crawl:    Spider

recon-automation:      
 

# Example Recon chain pack against target domaint/host : 

whois/certs -> dig -> dnsenum(internet subdomains)/gobuster(vhost subdomains) -> ReconSpyder -> FinalRecon  +  fingerprint tool in parallel 

```
