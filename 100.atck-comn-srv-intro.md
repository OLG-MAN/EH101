### Interacting with Common Services

### File Share Services

```
# A file sharing service is a type of service that provides, mediates, and monitors the transfer of computer files. 
# Years ago, businesses commonly used only internal services for file sharing, such as SMB, NFS, FTP, TFTP, SFTP, 
# but as cloud adoption grows, most companies now also have third-party cloud services such as 
# Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, SharePoint, or other forms of file storage such as 
# AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage. 
# We will be exposed to a mixture of internal and external file-sharing services, and we need to be familiar with them.
```

### Server Message Block (SMB)

```
# SMB is commonly used in Windows networks, and we will often find share folders in a Windows network. 
# We can interact with SMB using the GUI, CLI, or tools. Let us cover some common ways of interacting with SMB using Windows & Linux.
```

```
# Windows
[WINKEY] + [R]
\\192.168.220.129\Finance\                    # type in a dialog box

# If we do not have access, we will receive an authentication request.

C:\> dir \\192.168.220.129\Finance\           # Windows CMD - DIR
C:\> net use n: \\192.168.220.129\Finance     # net use command and map its content to the drive letter n.
C:\> net use n: \\192.168.220.129\Finance /user:plaintext Password123            # With creds
C:\> dir n: /a-d /s /b | find /c ":\"         # how many files the shared folder and its subdirs contain.

# Prev command explanation:
Syntax        Description
dir           Application
n:            Directory or drive to search
/a-d          /a is the attribute and -d means not directories
/s            Displays files in a specified directory and all subdirectories
/b            Uses bare format (no heading information or summary)

# With dir we can search for specific names in files such as:

cred
password
users
secrets
key
Common File Extensions for source code such as: .cs, .c, .go, .java, .php, .asp, .aspx, .html.

examples:
C:\>dir n:\*cred* /s /b
output:
n:\Contracts\private\credentials.txt

C:\>dir n:\*secret* /s /b
output:
n:\Contracts\private\secret.txt
```

### SMB + Win Search

```
# Windows CMD - Findstr

c:\>findstr /s /i cred n:\*.*
output:
n:\Contracts\private\secret.txt:file with all credentials
n:\Contracts\private\credentials.txt:admin:SecureCredentials!
```

[findstr](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/findstr)
[findstr-examples](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/findstr#examples)

```
# Windows PowerShell, New-PSDrive

PS C:\> Get-ChildItem \\192.168.220.129\Finance\
PS C:\> New-PSDrive -Name "N" -Root "\\192.168.220.129\Finance" -PSProvider "FileSystem"
```

```
# Windows PowerShell - PSCredential Object

PS C:\> $username = 'plaintext'
PS C:\> $password = 'Password123'
PS C:\> $secpassword = ConvertTo-SecureString $password -AsPlainText -Force
PS C:\> $cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential $username, $secpassword
PS C:\> New-PSDrive -Name "N" -Root "\\192.168.220.129\Finance" -PSProvider "FileSystem" -Credential $cred
```

```
# Windows PowerShell - GCI (Get-ChildItem)"
PS C:\> N:
PS N:\> (Get-ChildItem -File -Recurse | Measure-Object).Count

# Property -Include to find specific items:
PS C:\> Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Path N:\ -Include *cred* -File

# The Select-String cmdlet uses regular expression matching to search for text patterns:
PS C:\htb> Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Path N:\ | Select-String "cred" -List
```

### SMB + linux Search

```
# Linux - Mount SMB Shares

sudo apt install cifs-utils
sudo mkdir /mnt/Finance
sudo mount -t cifs -o username=plaintext,password=Password123,domain=. //192.168.220.129/Finance /mnt/Finance

# or with cred file:
mount -t cifs //192.168.220.129/Finance /mnt/Finance -o credentials=/path/credentialfile

# Cred file:
username=plaintext
password=Password123
domain=.
```

```
# Linux - Find

find /mnt/Finance/ -name *cred*     # Using find
grep -rn /mnt/Finance/ -ie cred     # Using grep
```

### Other Services

```
# Email

sudo apt-get install evolution      # Install evolution mail client
```

```
# Databases (MySQL, MSSQL)

mysql -u username -pPassword123 -h 10.129.20.13             # Use mysql tool to interact with MySQL on Linux
sqsh -S 10.129.20.13 -U username -P Password123             # Use sqsh tool to interact with MSSQL on Linux

C:\> mysql.exe -u username -pPassword123 -h 10.129.20.13    # Use mysql tool to interact with MySQL on Win           
C:\> sqlcmd -S 10.129.20.13 -U username -P Password123      # Use sqlcmd tool to interact with MSSQL on Win

# GUI Application: MySQL Workbench, SQL Server Management Studio or SSMS.
# dbeaver is a multi-platform database gui tool for Linux, macOS, and Windows 
# that supports connecting to multiple database engines such as MSSQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL etc.
# But I prefer HeidiSQL (Fast, Lightweight, Simple)
```
