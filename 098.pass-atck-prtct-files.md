```
# Hunting for Encoded Files

# Many different file extensions can identify these types of encrypted/encoded files. 
# For example, a useful list can be found on FileInfo.
However, for our example, we will only look at the most common "office" files like the following:

for ext in $(echo ".xls .xls* .xltx .csv .od* .doc .doc* .pdf .pot .pot* .pp*");
do echo -e "\nFile extension: " $ext; find / -name *$ext 2>/dev/null | grep -v "lib\|fonts\|share\|core" ;
done
```

```
# Hunting for SSH Keys

grep -rnw "PRIVATE KEY" /* 2>/dev/null | grep ":1"
output:
/home/cry0l1t3/.ssh/internal_db:1:-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
/home/cry0l1t3/.ssh/SSH.private:1:-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
...
```

```
# Encrypted SSH Keys

cat /home/cry0l1t3/.ssh/SSH.private
```

### Cracking with John

```
# John The Ripper has many different scripts to generate hashes from files that we can then use for cracking. 
# We can find these scripts on our system using the following command.

locate *2john*                             # Find all John tools and paths of them

# There is a Python script called ssh2john.py for SSH keys, 
# which generates the corresponding hashes for encrypted SSH keys, which we can then store in files.

ssh2john.py SSH.private > ssh.hash 
cat ssh.hash
output:
ssh.private:$sshng$0$8$1C258238FD2D6EB0$23...

# Next, we need to customize the commands accordingly with the password list 
# and specify our file with the hashes as the target to be cracked. 
# After that, we can display the cracked hashes by specifying the hash file and using the --show option.

john --wordlist=rockyou.txt ssh.hash
john ssh.hash --show
```

### Cracking Documents

```
# Cracking Microsoft Office Documents

office2john.py Protected.docx > protected-docx.hash
cat protected-docx.hash
john --wordlist=rockyou.txt protected-docx.hash
john protected-docx.hash --show
```

```
# Cracking PDFs

pdf2john.py PDF.pdf > pdf.hash
cat pdf.hash
john --wordlist=rockyou.txt pdf.hash
john pdf.hash --show
```

```
# One of the major difficulties in this process is the generation and mutation of password lists. 
# This is the prerequisite for successfully cracking the passwords for all password-protected files and access points. 
# This is because it is often no longer sufficient to use a known password list in most cases, 
# as these are known to the systems and are often recognized and blocked by integrated security mechanisms. 

# These types of files may be more difficult to crack (or not crackable at all within a reasonable amount of time) 
# because users may be forced to select a longer, randomly generated password or a passphrase. 
# Nevertheless, it is always worth attempting to crack password-protected documents 
# as they may yield sensitive data that could be useful to further our access.
```

```
# Task solution

# Hope you remember or saved this pass from prev section, check you pass mutation files. 
(hint: one of "Love You" passwords)

ssh kira@10.129.70.153
grep -rnw "PRIVATE KEY" /* 2>/dev/null | grep ":1"
# found an encrypted file, you download it with python http.server or updloadserver viceversa
# or you can simply copy/paste it to your host, because file is not big

locate *2john* | grep ssh2john.py
/usr/share/john/ssh2john.py kira.ssh > kira.hash
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt kira.hash
john ssh.hash --show
```

### Protected Archives

```
# Besides standalone files, there is also another format of files that can contain not only data, 
# such as an Office document or a PDF, but also other files within them. 
# This format is called an archive or compressed file that can be protected with a password if necessary.
```

[FileInfo.com](https://fileinfo.com/filetypes/compressed)

```
# There are many types of archive files. Some common file extensions include, but are not limited to:

tar         gz    rar         zip
vmdb/vmx	cpt   truecrypt   bitlocker
kdbx        luks  deb         7z
pkg         rpm   war         gzip

# An extensive list of archive types can be found on FileInfo.com. 
# However, instead of manually typing them out, we can also query them using a one-liner, 
# filter them out, and save them to a file if needed. 
# At the time of writing, there are 337(!) archive file types listed on fileinfo.com.

# Download All File Extensions (From FileInfo.com)
curl -s https://fileinfo.com/filetypes/compressed | html2text | awk '{print tolower($1)}' | grep "\." | tee -a compressed_ext.txt

# It is important to note that not all of the above archives support password protection. 
# Other tools are often used to protect the corresponding archives with a password. 
# For example, with tar, the tool openssl or gpg is used to encrypt the archives.
```

### Cracking Archives

```
# Given the number of different archives and the combination of tools, 
# we will show only some of the possible ways to crack specific archives in this section. 
```

### Cracking ZIP

```
zip2john ZIP.zip > zip.hash    # Using zip2john
output:
ver 2.0 efh 5455 efh 7875 ZIP.zip/flag.txt PKZIP Encr: 2b chk, TS_chk, cmplen=42, decmplen=30, crc=490E7510

cat zip.hash                   # Viewing the Contents of zip.hash
output:
ZIP.zip/customers.csv:$pkzip2$1*2*2*0*2a*1e*490e7510*0*42*0*2a*490e*409b*ef1e7feb7c1cf701a6ada7132e6a5c6c84c032401536faf7493df0294b0d5afc3464f14ec081cc0e18cb*$/pkzip2$:customers.csv:ZIP.zip::ZIP.zip
```

```
john --wordlist=rockyou.txt zip.hash      # Cracking the Hash with John

john zip.hash --show                      # Viewing the Cracked Hash
output:
ZIP.zip/customers.csv:1234:customers.csv:ZIP.zip::ZIP.zip
```

### Cracking OpenSSL Encrypted Archives

```
ls                           # Listing the Files
output:
GZIP.gzip  rockyou.txt

file GZIP.gzip               # Using file (try)
output: 
GZIP.gzip: openssl enc'd data with salted password

# Using a for-loop to Display Extracted Contents:
for i in $(cat rockyou.txt);do openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in GZIP.gzip -k $i 2>/dev/null| tar xz;done

# Once the for-loop has finished, we can look in current folder again to check if the cracking of the archive was successful.
ls
output:
customers.csv  GZIP.gzip  rockyou.txt
```

### Cracking BitLocker Encrypted Drives

```
# BitLocker is an encryption program for entire partitions and external drives. 
# Microsoft developed it for the Windows operating system. 
# It has been available since Windows Vista and uses the AES encryption algorithm with 128-bit or 256-bit length.
# If the password or PIN for BitLocker is forgotten, we can use the recovery key to decrypt the partition or drive. 
# The recovery key is a 48-digit string of numbers generated during BitLocker setup that also can be brute-forced.(!)

# We can use a script called bitlocker2john to extract the hash we need to crack. 
# Four different hashes will be extracted, which can be used with different Hashcat hash modes. 
# For our example, we will work with the first one, which refers to the BitLocker password.

bitlocker2john -i Backup.vhd > backup.hashes       # Using bitlocker2john
grep "bitlocker\$0" backup.hashes > backup.hash    
cat backup.hash
output:
$bitlocker$0$16$02b329c0453b9273f2fc1b927...

# Both John and Hashcat can be used for this purpose. 
# This example will look at the procedure with Hashcat. 
# The Hashcat mode for cracking BitLocker hashes is -m 22100:

hashcat -m 22100 backup.hash /opt/useful/seclists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt -o backup.cracked

cat backup.cracked   # Check cracked Bitlocker hash
output:
$bitlocker$0$16$02b329c0453b9273f2fc1b927443b...:1234qwer
```

```
# Task Solution

ssh kira@10.129.131.42    (L0vey0u1)
for ext in $(echo ".zip .gzip* ");do echo -e "\nFile extension: " $ext; find / -name *$ext 2>/dev/null | grep -v "lib\|fonts\|share\|core" ;done
cd Documents

python3 -m http.server 8080       # on Target host

john --wordlist=./mut_password.list zip.hash 
john zip.hash --show
```

### Password Policies


```
# Main tips for passwords policy:

Minimum of 8 characters.
Include uppercase and lowercase letters.
Include at least one number.
Include at least one special character.
It should not be the username.
It should be changed every 60 days.
```

```
# Based on this example, we must include, as part of our password policies, some blacklisted words, which include, but are not limited to:

Company's name
Common words associated with the company
Names of months
Names of seasons
Variations on the word welcome and password
Common and guessable words such as password, 123456, and abcde
```

```
# Creating a Good password services:
```
[Password Monster](https://www.passwordmonster.com/)
[1Password Password Generator](https://1password.com/password-generator/)


```
# `CjDC2x[U` was the password generated by the tool, and it is a good password. 
# It would take a long time to crack and would likely not be guessed or obtained in a password spraying attack, 
# but it is tough to remember.

# We can create good passwords with ordinary words, phrases, and even songs that we like. 
# Here is an example of a good password This is my secure password or The name of my dog is Poppy. 
"HorseBatteryStample" method.

### Password Managers

```
# Online Password Managers
# One of the key elements when deciding on a password manager is convenience. 
# A typical person has 3 or 4 devices and uses them to log in to different websites, applications, etc. 
# An online password manager allows the user to synchronize its encrypted password database between multiples devices, most of them provide:

A mobile application.
A browser add-on.
Some other features that we'll discuss later in this section.

# You can check Bitwarden, 1Password and LastPass documentation as a reference, but there are many others. 
```

[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/images/resources/security-white-paper-download.pdf)
[1Password](https://1passwordstatic.com/files/security/1password-white-paper.pdf)
[LastPass](https://assets.cdngetgo.com/da/ce/d211c1074dea84e06cad6f2c8b8e/lastpass-technical-whitepaper.pdf)

```
# Most popular online password managers are:

1Password
Bitwarden
Dashlane
Keeper
Lastpass
NordPass
RoboForm
```

### Local Password Managers

```
# The most popular local password managers are:

KeePass
KWalletManager
Pleasant Password Server
Password Safe
```

```
# When deciding on a cloud or local password manager, we need to understand its features, 
# Wikipedia has a list of password managers (online and local) as well as some of their features. 
# Here's a list of the most common features for password managers:

2FA support.
Multi-platform (Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, Mac, etc.).
Browser Extension.
Login Autocomplete.
Import and export capabilities.
Password generation.
```

### Alternatives

```
# Some of the most common ways to secure identities beyond passwords are:

Multi-factor Authentication.
FIDO2 open authentication standard, which enables users to leverage common devices like Yubikey, to authenticate easily.
One-Time Password (OTP).
Time-based one-time password (TOTP).
IP restriction.
Device Compliance. Examples: Endpoint Manager or Workspace ONE
```

### Passwordless

```
# Multiples companies like Microsoft, Auth0, Okta, Ping Identity, etc, 
# are trying to promote the Passwordless strategy, to remove the password as the way of authentication.
```

```
# You can read more about Passwordless authentication and different vendors' strategies:
```
[Microsoft Passwordless](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access-management/passwordless-authentication)
[Auth0 Passwordless](https://auth0.com/passwordless)
[Okta Passwordless](https://www.okta.com/passwordless-authentication/)
