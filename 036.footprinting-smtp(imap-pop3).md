### SMTP
```
# The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a protocol for sending emails in an IP network.
# SMTP is often combined with the IMAP or POP3 protocols, which can fetch emails and send emails.
# By default, SMTP servers accept connection requests on port 25. However, can also use other ports such as TCP port 587.
# To prevent unauthorized reading of data, the SMTP is used in conjunction with SSL/TLS encryption.
# standard TCP port 25 for the encrypted connection, for example, TCP port 465.

```

### Destination chain on SMTP server
```
Client (MUA) ➞ Submission Agent (MSA) ➞ Open Relay (MTA) ➞ Mail Delivery Agent (MDA) ➞ Mailbox (POP3/IMAP)

# Mail User Agent (MUA)
# Mail Transfer Agent (MTA)
# Mail Submission Agent (MSA) also called Relay server
# Mail delivery agent (MDA)    

# "Open Relay" Attack can be carried out on many SMTP servers due to incorrect configuration.

```

### Default configs

```
cat /etc/postfix/main.cf | grep -v "#" | sed -r "/^\s*$/d"

# output
smtpd_banner = ESMTP Server 
biff = no
append_dot_mydomain = no
readme_directory = no
compatibility_level = 2
smtp_tls_session_cache_database = btree:${data_directory}/smtp_scache
myhostname = mail1.inlanefreight.htb
alias_maps = hash:/etc/aliases
alias_database = hash:/etc/aliases
smtp_generic_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/generic
mydestination = $myhostname, localhost 
masquerade_domains = $myhostname
mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8 10.129.0.0/16
mailbox_size_limit = 0
recipient_delimiter = +
smtp_bind_address = 0.0.0.0
inet_protocols = ipv4
smtpd_helo_restrictions = reject_invalid_hostname
home_mailbox = /home/postfix

```

### Basic SMTP commands
```
AUTH PLAIN	   # AUTH is a service extension used to authenticate the client.
HELO	       # The client logs in with its computer name and thus starts the session.
MAIL FROM	   # The client names the email sender.
RCPT TO	       # The client names the email recipient.
DATA	       # The client initiates the transmission of the email.
RSET	       # The client aborts the initiated transmission but keeps the connection between client and server.
VRFY	       # The client checks if a mailbox is available for message transfer.
EXPN	       # The client also checks if a mailbox is available for messaging with this command.
NOOP	       # The client requests a response from the server to prevent disconnection due to time-out.
QUIT	       # The client terminates the session.

```

### Operating SMTP with telnet

``` 
telnet 10.129.14.128 25          # connection with telnet tool

# ouput
Trying 10.129.14.128...
Connected to 10.129.14.128.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 ESMTP Server

# output

Hey man, I am trying to access our XY-DB but the creds don't work. 
Did you make any changes there?
.

250 2.0.0 Ok: queued as 6E1CF1681AB


QUIT                                                         # terminate session 

# output
221 2.0.0 Bye

```

### Dangerous Settings
```
mynetworks = 0.0.0.0/0    # (!)
```


### Footprinting the Service
```
sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -sC -sV -p25                          # enumerate SMTP with nmap and smtp script in default NSE scripts
sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -p25 --script smtp-open-relay -v      # enumerate and grab some info with nmap smtp-open-raly script
sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -p25 --script smtp-enum-users \       # SMTP user enum with nmap script (working sometimes)
--script-args smtp-enum-users.methods={VRFY}   

smtp-user-enum -M VRFY -U users.txt -t 10.129.14.128 -v      # Enum users with tool and users-wordlist file
```

### IMAP / POP3 
```
# Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)
# Post Office Protocol (POP3)
# The client establishes the connection to the server via port 143. For communication, it uses text-based commands in ASCII format.
# The encrypted connection uses the standard port 143 or an alternative port such as 993.
```


### Default configuration
```
# Install two packages to interact with IMAP/POP3
apt install dovecot-imapd
apt install dovecot-pop3d


# Configs are decribed in docs:
https://doc.dovecot.org/settings/core/
https://doc.dovecot.org/configuration_manual/service_configuration/

```

### IMAP Commands
``` 
1 LOGIN                         # username password	User's login.
1 LIST "" *	                    # Lists all directories.
1 CREATE "INBOX"	            # Creates a mailbox with a specified name.
1 DELETE "INBOX"	            # Deletes a mailbox.
1 RENAME "ToRead" "Important"	# Renames a mailbox.
1 LSUB "" *	                    # Returns a subset of names from the set of names that the User has declared as being active or subscribed.
1 SELECT INBOX	                # Selects a mailbox so that messages in the mailbox can be accessed.
1 UNSELECT INBOX	            # Exits the selected mailbox.
1 FETCH <ID> all	            # Retrieves data associated with a message in the mailbox.
1 CLOSE	                        # Removes all messages with the Deleted flag set.
1 LOGOUT	                    # Closes the connection with the IMAP server.
```

### POP3
```
USER username	  # Identifies the user.
PASS password	  # Authentication of the user using its password.
STAT	          # Requests the number of saved emails from the server.
LIST	          # Requests from the server the number and size of all emails.
RETR id	          # Requests the server to deliver the requested email by ID.
DELE id	          # Requests the server to delete the requested email by ID.
CAPA	          # Requests the server to display the server capabilities.
RSET	          # Requests the server to reset the transmitted information.
QUIT	          # Closes the connection with the POP3 server.
```

### Dangerous Settings
```
auth_debug	                  # Enables all authentication debug logging.
auth_debug_passwords	      # This setting adjusts log verbosity, the submitted passwords, and the scheme gets logged.
auth_verbose	              # Logs unsuccessful authentication attempts and their reasons.
auth_verbose_passwords	      # Passwords used for authentication are logged and can also be truncated.
auth_anonymous_username	      # This specifies the username to be used when logging in with the ANONYMOUS SASL mechanism.
```

### Footprinting the Service
```
# By default, ports 110 and 995 are used for POP3, and ports 143 and 993 are used for IMAP. (993 and 995) use TLS/SSL

sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -p110,143,993,995 -sV -sC         # get info about imap/pop3 with nmap
curl -k 'imaps://10.129.14.128' --user user:p4ssw0rd      # login, check users, (with known creds)
curl -k 'imaps://10.129.14.128' --user cry0l1t3:1234 -v   # the same but with verbose mode, more info

openssl s_client -connect 10.129.14.128:pop3s             # connect to POP3 over SSL with openssl tool
openssl s_client -connect 10.129.14.128:imaps             # connect to IMAP over SSL with openssl tool

ncat 10.129.14.128:pop3s     # the same with ncat tool (?) 
ncat 10.129.14.128:imaps     #
```
