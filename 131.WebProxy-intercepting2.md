### Repeating Requests

```
# Request repeating allows us to resend any web request that has previously gone through the web proxy. 
# This allows us to make quick changes to any request before we send it, 
# then get the response within our tools without intercepting and modifying each request.
```

### Proxy History

```
# To start, we can view the HTTP requests history in Burp at (Proxy>HTTP History).

# In ZAP HUD, we can find it in the bottom History pane or ZAP's main UI at the bottom History tab as well.

# Both tools also provide filtering and sorting options for requests history, 
# which may be helpful if we deal with a huge number of requests and want to locate a specific request. 
```

```
# Note: Both tools also maintain WebSockets history, which shows all connections initiated 
# by the web application even after being loaded, like asynchronous updates and data fetching. 

# WebSockets can be useful when performing advanced web penetration testing, and are out of the scope of this module.
```

```
# Tip: While ZAP only shows the final/modified request that was sent, 
# Burp provides the ability to examine both the original request and the modified request. 
# If a request was edited, the pane header would say Original Request, 
# and we can click on it and select Edited Request to examine the final request that was sent
```

### Repeating Requests, Burp


```
# Once we locate the request we want to repeat, we can click [CTRL+R] in Burp to send it to the Repeater tab, 
# and then we can either navigate to the Repeater tab or click [CTRL+SHIFT+R] to go to it directly. 
# Once in Repeater, we can click on Send to send the request.
```

```
# Tip: 
# We can also right-click on the request and select Change Request Method to change the HTTP method 
# between POST/GET without having to rewrite the entire request.
```

### Repeating Requests, ZAP

```
# In ZAP, once we locate our request, we can right-click on it and select Open/Resend with Request Editor, 
# which would open the request editor window, and allow us to resend the request with the Send button to send our request.

# We can also see the Method drop-down menu, allowing us to quickly switch the request method to any other HTTP method.

# We can achieve the same result within the pre-configured browser with ZAP HUD. 
# We can locate the request in the bottom History pane, and once we click on it, 
# the Request Editor window will show, allowing us to resend it. 

# We can select Replay in Console to get the response in the same HUD window, 
# or select Replay in Browser to see the response rendered in the browser:
```

### Task Solution

```
# ZAP

# Get request with ip=1, right click and "Open in editor", then try diff commands
# Finally flag in /

# Burp

# Get request with ip=1, right click and "Send to repeater", next try diff commands
# Finally flag in /
```

### Encoding/Decoding

```
# It is essential to ensure that our request data is URL-encoded and our request headers are correctly set. 
# Otherwise, we may get a server error in the response. 
# This is why encoding and decoding data becomes essential as we modify and repeat web requests. 
# Some of the key characters we need to encode are:

- Spaces:    # May indicate the end of request data if not encoded
- &:         # Otherwise interpreted as a parameter delimiter
- #:         # Otherwise interpreted as a fragment identifier

# To URL-encode text in Burp Repeater, we can select that text and right-click on it, 
# then select (Convert Selection>URL>URL encode key characters), or by selecting the text and clicking [CTRL+U]. 
# Burp also supports URL-encoding as we type if we right-click and enable that option, which will encode all of our text as we type it. 

# On the other hand, ZAP should automatically URL-encode all of our request data in the background before sending the request, 
# though we may not see that explicitly.
```

### Decoding

```
# While URL-encoding is key to HTTP requests, it is not the only type of encoding we will encounter. 
# It is very common for web applications to encode their data, 
# so we should be able to quickly decode that data to examine the original text. 

# On the other hand, back-end servers may expect data to be encoded in a particular format or with a specific encoder, 
# so we need to be able to quickly encode our data before we send it.

# The following are some of the other types of encoders supported by both tools:

- HTML
- Unicode
- Base64
- ASCII hex
```

```
# To access the full encoder in Burp, we can go to the Decoder tab. 
# In ZAP, we can use the Encoder/Decoder/Hash by clicking [CTRL+E]. 

# With these encoders, we can input any text and have it quickly encoded or decoded. 
# For example, perhaps we came across the following cookie that is base64 encoded, 
# and we need to decode it: eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6Imd1ZXN0IiwgImlzX2FkbWluIjpmYWxzZX0=

# We can input the above string in Burp Decoder and select Decode as > Base64.
```

### Encoding

```
# As we can see, the text holds the value {"username":"guest", "is_admin":false}. 
# So, if we were performing a penetration test on a web application and find that the cookie holds this value, 
# we may want to test modifying it to see whether it changes our user privileges. 

# So, we can copy the above value, change guest to admin and false to true, 
# and try to encode it again using its original encoding method (base64).
```

```
# Tip: 
# Burp Decoder output can be directly encoded/decoded with a different encoder. 
# Select the new encoder method in the output pane at the bottom, and it will be encoded/decoded again. 
# In ZAP, we can copy the output text and paste it in the input field above.
```

```
# We can then copy the base64 encoded string and use it with our request in Burp Repeater or ZAP Request Editor. 
# The same concept can be used to encode and decode various types of encoded text to perform effective web penetration testing 
# without utilizing other tools to do the encoding.
```

### Task Solution

```
# Using burp decoder decode 5 times flag with base64->base64->base64->base64->URL

# Using ZAP and tool encode/decode/hash and just copy/paste 4 times first decode base64 output, next in URL decode I'll see the flag.
```

### Proxying Tools

```
# An important aspect of using web proxies is enabling the interception of web requests made by command-line tools 
# and thick client applications. 
# This gives us transparency into the web requests made by these applications 
# and allows us to utilize all of the different proxy features we have used with web applications.

# To route all web requests made by a specific tool through our web proxy tools, 
# we have to set them up as the tool's proxy (i.e. http://127.0.0.1:8080), 
# similarly to what we did with our browsers.

# Note: Proxying tools usually slows them down, therefore, 
# only proxy tools when you need to investigate their requests, and not for normal usage.
```

### Proxychains

[Proxychains](https://github.com/haad/proxychains)

```
# To use proxychains, we first have to edit /etc/proxychains.conf, 
# comment out the final line and add the following line at the end of it:

# socks4         127.0.0.1 9050
http 127.0.0.1 8080
```

```
# We should also enable Quiet Mode to reduce noise by un-commenting quiet_mode.
# let's try using cURL on one of our previous exercises:

proxychains curl http://SERVER_IP:PORT

# If all is ok, we go back to our web proxy (Burp in this case), and we will see that the request has indeed gone through it
```

### Nmap

```
# To find out how to use the proxy configurations for any tool, we can view its manual with man nmap, or its help page with nmap -h:
# So, We can use the --proxies flag. We should also add the -Pn flag to skip host discovery (as recommended on the man page). 
# Finally, we'll also use the -sC flag to examine what an nmap script scan does:

nmap --proxies http://127.0.0.1:8080 SERVER_IP -pPORT -Pn -sC

# Once again, if we go to our web proxy tool, we will see all of the requests made by nmap in the proxy history.

# Note: Nmap's built-in proxy is still in its experimental phase, as mentioned by its manual (man nmap), 
# so not all functions or traffic may be routed through the proxy. 
# In these cases, we can simply resort to proxychains, as we did earlier.
```

### Metasploit

```
# Finally, let's try to proxy web traffic made by Metasploit modules to better investigate and debug them. 
# We should begin by starting Metasploit with msfconsole. 
# Then, to set a proxy for any exploit within Metasploit, we can use the set PROXIES flag. 
# Let's try the robots_txt scanner as an example and run it against one of our previous exercises:

msfconsole
msf6 > use auxiliary/scanner/http/robots_txt
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/http/robots_txt) > set PROXIES HTTP:127.0.0.1:8080
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/http/robots_txt) > set RHOST SERVER_IP
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/http/robots_txt) > set RPORT PORT
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/http/robots_txt) > run

# Once again, we can go back to our web proxy tool of choice and examine the proxy history to view all sent requests.
# We see that the request has indeed gone through our web proxy. 
# The same method can be used with other scanners, exploits, and other features in Metasploit.
```

### Task Solution

```
msfconsole

use auxiliary/scanner/http/http_put
options

set PROXIES HTTP:127.0.0.1:8080
set RHOST <SERVER-IP>
set RPORT <PORT>
run

# After run you will see intercepted request-response in Burp/ZAP with the target info row after headers info
```
