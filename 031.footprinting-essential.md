### Three layers of Enumeration Metodology
#### Infrastructure-based enumeration
```
1. Internet Presence	# Identification of internet presence and externally accessible infrastructure.	
--- Domains, Subdomains, vHosts, ASN, Netblocks, IP Addresses, Cloud Instances, Security Measures ---

2. Gateway	            # Identify the possible security measures to protect the company's external and internal infrastructure.	
--- Firewalls, DMZ, IPS/IDS, EDR, Proxies, NAC, Network Segmentation, VPN, Cloudflare ---
```

#### Host-based enumeration
```

3. Accessible Services	# Identify accessible interfaces and services that are hosted externally or internally.	
--- Service Type, Functionality, Configuration, Port, Version, Interface ---

4. Processes	        # Identify the internal processes, sources, and destinations associated with the services.	
--- PID, Processed Data, Tasks, Source, Destination ---
```

#### OS-based enumeration
```

5. Privileges	        # Identification of the internal permissions and privileges to the accessible services.	
--- Groups, Users, Permissions, Restrictions, Environment ---

6. OS Setup	            # Identification of the internal components and systems setup.	
--- OS Type, Patch Level, Network config, OS Environment, Configuration files, sensitive private files ---
```

### Certificate Transparency
```
curl -s https://crt.sh/\?q\=inlanefreight.com\&output\=json | jq .         # Get domain related certs info in json format
curl -s https://crt.sh/\?q\=inlanefreight.com\&output\=json | jq '.[0]'    # Get first (newest) domain related cert.
curl -s https://crt.sh/\?q\=inlanefreight.com\&output\=json | jq . \
| grep name | cut -d":" -f2 | grep -v "CN=" | cut -d'"' -f2 | awk '{gsub(/\\n/,"\n");}1;' | sort -u > subdomainlist   # Sort unique subdomains, save to list

for i in $(cat subdomainlist);do host $i | grep "has address" | grep inlanefreight.com | cut -d" " -f1,4;done         # Host IP's list related to subdomains
for i in $(cat subdomainlist);do host $i | grep "has address" | grep inlanefreight.com | cut -d" " -f4 >> ip-addresses.txt;done     # Save IP's list to file
for i in $(cat ip-addresses.txt);do shodan host $i;done       # Get extended IP host info with shodan (need api-key, but you can also use shodan.io)

dig any inlanefreight.com        # Get DNS info with dig tool
# Few words. We need to look more on TXT records because they often related to 3rd party, supply chain services, and help us with entry vectors.
```

### Cloud Resources
```
for i in $(cat subdomainlist);do host $i | grep "has address" | grep inlanefreight.com | cut -d" " -f1,4;done      # check cloud buckets in domains.
intext:<VALUES> inurl:amazonaws.com / blob.core.windows.net                                   # We can also use Google Dorks "inurl:" and "intext:". 
https://domain.glass/inlanefreight.com               # useful service for showing buckets if they are exist on domain, and many other detailed info.
https://buckets.grayhatwarfare.com/                  # anther hady service to bucket related to domain and even some files in it.

```

### Staff 
```
Linkedin -> bio -> github repos -> some valuable info     # possible vector of gathering info about company stuff
```
