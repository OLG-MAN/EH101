### Web Shells

```
# A web shell is a browser-based shell session we can use to interact with the underlying operating system of a web server. 

# During external penetration tests, it's most commonly "get in" (gain a foothold inside the internal network) via web application attacks 
# (file upload attacks, SQL injection, RFI/LFI, command injection, etc.), 
# password spraying (against RDS, VPN portals, Citrix, OWA, and other applications using Active Directory authentication), and social engineering.

# Web applications are often the majority of what exposed during an external network assessment 
# and often present an enormous attack surface. 
# Publicly available file upload forms that can possible directly upload a PHP, JSP, or ASP.NET web shell.

# Also come across applications such as Tomcat, Axis2, or WebLogic, which allow to deploy JSP code via a WAR file as part of their functionality. 
# Even a misconfigured FTP service that allows file uploads directly to the server's webroot.

# To achieve persistence on a system, in many cases, this is the initial way of gaining remote code execution via a web application, 
# which we can then use to later upgrade to a more interactive reverse shell.

### Laudanum, One Webshell to Rule Them All

[Laudanum Repo](https://github.com/jbarcia/Web-Shells/tree/master/laudanum)

```
# The Laudanum files can be found in the /usr/share/laudanum directory.
# For most of the files within Laudanum, you can copy them as-is and place them where you need them on the victim to run.
```

```
# Laudanum Demonstration

/etc/hosts  ->   <target ip> status.inlanefreight.local                 # Add target host IP to hosts file
cp /usr/share/laudanum/aspx/shell.aspx /home/user/demo.aspx             # Copy web shell file to user pwd

# Add your localhost IP address to the allowedIps variable on line 59.
# Using status.inlanefreight.local page and use upload option in the site footer

# Once the upload of demo.aspx is successful, you will need to navigate to your web shell to utilize its functions
# by path http://status.inlanefreight.local\\files\demo.aspx   (yep, with reverted slashes)

# We can now utilize the Laudanum shell we uploaded to issue cmd commands to the host. (systeminfo, dir, ipconfig etc.)
```

### Antak Webshell

```
# The great resource to use in learning is IPPSEC's blog site ippsec.rocks. 
# The site is a powerful learning tool. 

# His site crawls the descriptions of each of the videos he has posted on YouTube and recommends a timestamp associated with that keyword. 
# When we click one of the links, it will take us to that section of the video where this concept is demonstrated. (!)

```

```
# ASPX Explained

# On a web server running the ASP.NET framework, web form pages can be generated for users to input data. 
# On the server side, the information will be converted into HTML
```

```
# Antak Webshell

# Antak is a web shell built-in ASP.Net included within the Nishang project. 
# Nishang is an Offensive PowerShell toolset that can provide options for any portion of your pentest. 
```

```
# Working with Antak


ls /usr/share/nishang/Antak-WebShell                                                # check Antak on your host
cp /usr/share/nishang/Antak-WebShell/antak.aspx /home/administrator/Upload.aspx     # copy(create) new file in you pwd

# Add target IP host to /etc/hosts 
# Make sure you set credentials for access to the web shell. Modify line 14
# Upload the file and then navigate to the page for use.

# It will give you a user and password prompt. Remember, with this web application, the files are stored in the \\files\ directory. 
# When you navigate to the upload.aspx file, you should see a normal login prompt.
# Now we can use PS commands in this web-shell
``` 

### PHP Web Shells

```
# Hypertext Preprocessor or PHP is an open-source general-purpose scripting language typically used as part of a web stack that powers a website. 
# According to a recent survey conducted by W3Techs, "PHP is used by 75.8% of all websites" (Sept 2024)
```

```
# Hands-on With a PHP-Based Web Shell.

# We will be using WhiteWinterWolf's PHP Web Shell. We can download this or copy and paste the source code into a .php file. 
# Keep in mind that the file type is significant, as we will soon witness.
# Our goal is to upload the PHP web shell via the Vendor Logo browse button. 
# Attempting to do this initially will fail since rConfig is checking for the file type. 
# It will only allow uploading image file types (.png,.jpg,.gif, etc.). 
# However, we can bypass this utilizing Burp Suite.

# Start Burp Suite, navigate to the browser's network settings menu and fill out the proxy settings. 
# 127.0.0.1 will go in the IP address field, and 8080 will go in the port field to ensure all requests pass through Burp.
# Note: We need to use Burp internal browser not our regular browser

# Our goal is to change the content-type to bypass the file type restriction in uploading files
# Note: We confirm each request with php website by clicking forward few times (and changing request details of need)

# With Burp open and our web browser proxy settings properly configured, we can now upload the PHP web shell. 
# Click the browse button, navigate to wherever our .php file is stored on our attack box, and select open and Save

# We will change Content-type from application/x-php to image/gif. 
# This will essentially "trick" the server and allow us to upload the .php file, bypassing the file type restriction. 

# Once we do this, we can select Forward twice, and the file will be submitted. 
# We can turn the Burp interceptor off now and go back to the browser to see the results.

# The message: 'Added new vendor NetVen to Database` lets us know our file upload was successful.
# We can now attempt to use our web shell by path .:

http://<SITE-IP>/images/vendor/<name-of-script>.php

# Considerations when Dealing with Web Shells

# When utilizing web shells, consider the below potential issues that may arise during your penetration testing process:

- Web applications sometimes automatically delete files after a pre-defined period

- Limited interactivity with the operating system in terms of navigating the file system, downloading and uploading files, 
chaining commands together may not work (ex. whoami && hostname), slowing progress, 
especially when performing enumeration -Potential instability through a non-interactive web shell

- Greater chance of leaving behind proof that we were successful in our attack
