### Plaugins

[Plugins](https://www.rubydoc.info/github/rapid7/metasploit-framework/Msf/Plugin) 

```
# Plugins are readily available software that has already been released by third parties and have given approval to the creators of Metasploit 
# to integrate their software inside the framework.

# Plugins work directly with the API and can be used to manipulate the entire framework. 
# They can be useful for automating repetitive tasks, adding new commands to the msfconsole, and extending the already powerful framework.
```

### Using Plugins

```
# To start using a plugin, we will need to ensure it is installed in the correct directory on our machine. 
# Navigating to /usr/share/metasploit-framework/plugins, which is the default directory for every new installation of msfconsole, 
# should show us which plugins we have to our availability:

ls /usr/share/metasploit-framework/plugins         # Check plugins in related folder
msf6 > load nessus                                 # E.g. laod nessus plugin
msf6 > load Plugin_That_Does_Not_Exist             # Trying to use unexisted plugin with error
output:
[-] Failed to load plugin from .../Plugin_That_Does_Not_Exist.rb: ...
```

### Installing new plugins

```
git clone https://github.com/darkoperator/Metasploit-Plugins     # Clone repo with plugins (not  only from metaspoit)
sudo cp ./Metasploit-Plugins/pentest.rb /usr/share/metasploit-framework/plugins/pentest.rb   # Copy plugin to metaspoit plugin folder

msf6 > load pentest                                # Load/Run plugin
msf6 > help                                        # Check plugin options

### Mixins

[More here](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Metasploit/UsingMixins)

```
# Mixins are classes that act as methods for use by other classes without having to be the parent class of those other classes. 
# Thus, it would be deemed inappropriate to call it inheritance but rather inclusion. They are mainly used when we:

- Want to provide a lot of optional features for a class.
- Want to use one particular feature for a multitude of classes.
```
