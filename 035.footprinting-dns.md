### Types of DNS servers
```
DNS Root Server	     # The root servers of the DNS are responsible for the top-level domains (TLD). 
                     # As the last instance, they are only requested if the name server does not respond. 
                     # Thus, a root server is a central interface between users and content on the Internet, as it links domain and IP address. 
                     # The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) coordinates the work of the root name servers. 
                     # There are 13 such root servers around the globe.

Authoritative Nameserver        # Authoritative name servers hold authority for a particular zone. 
                                # They only answer queries from their area of responsibility, and their information is binding. 
                                # If an authoritative name server cannot answer a client's query, the root name server takes over at that point.

Non-authoritative Nameserver	# Non-authoritative name servers are not responsible for a particular DNS zone. 
                                # Instead, they collect information on specific DNS zones themselves, which is done using recursive or iterative DNS querying.

Caching DNS Server	        # Caching DNS servers cache information from other name servers for a specified period. 
                                # The authoritative name server determines the duration of this storage.

Forwarding Server	        # Forwarding servers perform only one function: they forward DNS queries to another DNS server.

Resolver	                # Resolvers are not authoritative DNS servers but perform name resolution locally in the computer or router.      
```

### DNS records
```
A	    # Returns an IPv4 address of the requested domain as a result.
AAAA	    # Returns an IPv6 address of the requested domain.
MX	    # Returns the responsible mail servers as a result.
NS	    # Returns the DNS servers (nameservers) of the domain.

TXT	    # This record can contain various information. The all-rounder can be used, e.g., 
            # to validate the Google Search Console or validate SSL certificates. 
            # In addition, SPF and DMARC entries are set to validate mail traffic and protect it from spam.

CNAME	    # This record serves as an alias for another domain name. If you want the domain www.hackthebox.eu to point to the same IP as hackthebox.eu, 
            # you would create an A record for hackthebox.eu and a CNAME record for www.hackthebox.eu.

PTR	    # The PTR record works the other way around (reverse lookup). It converts IP addresses into valid domain names.
SOA	    # Provides information about the corresponding DNS zone and email address of the administrative contact.

# Example. Check domain info with soa record
dig soa www.inlanefreight.com
```

### DNS configs
```
# Three different types of configuration

1. local DNS configuration files
2. zone files
3. reverse name resolution files

# e.g. Bind9 DNS server using named.conf divied on local files like:
named.conf.local
named.conf.options
named.conf.log

# Check Bind9 configs  (Local DNS Configuration)
cat /etc/bind/named.conf.local

# Check Bind9 zone files
cat /etc/bind/db.domain.com

# Check Reverse Name Resolution Zone Files
cat /etc/bind/db.10.129.14

# Dangerous Settings
allow-query	   # Defines which hosts are allowed to send requests to the DNS server.
allow-recursion	   # Defines which hosts are allowed to send recursive requests to the DNS server.
allow-transfer	   # Defines which hosts are allowed to receive zone transfers from the DNS server.
zone-statistics	   # Collects statistical data of zones.
```
