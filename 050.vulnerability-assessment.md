### Security Assessments

```
# Every organization must perform different types of Security assessments on their networks, computers, and applications at least every so often. 
# The primary purpose of most types of security assessments is to find and confirm vulnerabilities are present, so we can work to patch, 
# mitigate, or remove them. 
# There are different ways and methodologies to test how secure a computer system is. 
# Some types of security assessments are more appropriate for certain networks than others. But they all serve a purpose in improving cybersecurity.
```

### Vulnerability Assessment

```
# Vulnerability assessments are appropriate for all organizations and networks. 
# A vulnerability assessment is based on a particular security standard, and compliance with these standards is analyzed (e.g., going through a checklist).

# A vulnerability assessment can be based on various security standards. 
# Which standards apply to a particular network will depend on many factors. 
# These factors can include industry-specific and regional data security regulations, the size and form of a company's network, 
# which types of applications they use or develop, and their security maturity level.
```

### Penetration Test

```
# They're called penetration tests because testers conduct them to determine if and how they can penetrate a network. 
# A pentest is a type of simulated cyber attack, and pentesters conduct actions that a threat actor may perform 
# to see if certain kinds of exploits are possible. 
# The key difference between a pentest and an actual cyber attack is that the former is done with the full legal consent of the entity being pentested.


# Pentest Types:

- Black box:
# pentesting is done with no knowledge of a network's configuration or applications. 
# Typically a tester will either be given network access (or an ethernet port and have to bypass Network Access Control NAC) 
# and nothing else (requiring them to perform their own discovery for IP addresses) if the pentest is internal, 
# or nothing more than the company name if the pentest is from an external standpoint.

- Grey box:
# pentesting is done with a little bit of knowledge of the network they're testing, 
# from a perspective equivalent to an employee who doesn't work in the IT department, 
# such as a receptionist or customer service agent.

- White box:
# pentesting is typically conducted by giving the penetration tester full access to all systems, configurations, build documents, etc., 
# and source code if web applications are in-scope. 
# The goal here is to discover as many flaws as possible that would be difficult or impossible to discover blindly in a reasonable amount of time.

- Application:
# pentesters assess web applications, thick-client applications, APIs, and mobile applications. 
# They will often be well-versed in source code review and able to assess a given web application 
# from a black box or white box standpoint (typically a secure code review).

- Network or infrastructure:
# pentesters assess all aspects of a computer network, including its networking devices such as routers and firewalls, workstations, servers, and applications. # These types of penetration testers typically must have a strong understanding of networking, Windows, Linux, Active Directory, 
# and at least one scripting language.

- Physical:
# pentesters try to leverage physical security weaknesses and breakdowns in processes to gain access to a facility such as a data center or office building.

- Social engineering:
# pentesters test human beings.


# Pentesting is most appropriate for organizations with a medium or high security maturity level. 
# Security maturity measures how well developed a company's cybersecurity program is, and security maturity takes years to build.

# Organizations with a lower security maturity level may want to focus on vulnerability assessments 
# because a pentest could find too many vulnerabilities to be useful and could overwhelm staff tasked with remediation.

```

```
# Vulnerability Assessments and Penetration Tests are two completely different assessments. 
# Vulnerability assessments just look for vulnerabilities in networks without simulating cyber attacks.
```

### Other Types of Security Assessments

```
- Security audits:
# are typically requirements from outside the organization, and they're typically mandated by government agencies or industry associations 
# to assure that an organization is compliant with specific security regulations.

- Bug Bounties:
# are implemented by all kinds of organizations. 
# They invite members of the general public, with some restrictions (usually no automated scanning), 
# to find security vulnerabilities in their applications.

- Red Team Assessment:
# Companies with larger budgets and more resources can hire their own dedicated red teams 
# or use the services of third-party consulting firms to perform red team assessments. 

- Purple Team Assessment:
# Purple teams are formed when offensive and defensive security specialists work together with a common goal, to improve the security of their network. 
# Red teams find security problems, and blue teams learn about those problems from their red teams and work to fix them.
```


### Understanding Key Terms

```
# A Vulnerability is a weakness or bug in an organization's environment, including applications, networks, and infrastructure, 
# that opens up the possibility of threats from external actors. 
# Vulnerabilities can be registered through MITRE's Common Vulnerability Exposure database (CVE)
# and receive a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score to determine severity. 

- Threat:
# is a process that amplifies the potential of an adverse event, such as a threat actor exploiting a vulnerability. 

- Exploit:
is any code or resources that can be used to take advantage of an asset's weakness. 

- Risk:
is the possibility of assets or data being harmed or destroyed by threat actors.
```


### Asset Inventory

```
# Asset inventory is a critical component of vulnerability management. 
# An organization needs to understand what assets are in its network to provide the proper protection and set up appropriate defenses. 
# The asset inventory should include information technology, operational technology, physical, software, mobile, and development assets. 


# Application and System Inventory:
# Data assets include:

- All data stored on-premises. HDDs and SSDs in endpoints (PCs and mobile devices), HDDs & SSDs in servers, 
external drives in the local network, optical media (DVDs, Blu-ray discs, CDs), flash media (USB sticks, SD cards). 

- All of the data storage that their cloud provider possesses. 
Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure are some of the most popular cloud providers, but there are many more.

- All data stored within various Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications. 
This data is also "in the cloud" but might not all be within the scope of a corporate cloud provider account. 

- All of the applications a company needs to use to conduct their usual operation and business. 

- All of a company's on-premises computer networking devices. 
These include but aren't limited to routers, firewalls, hubs, switches, dedicated intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS), 
data loss prevention (DLP) systems, and so on.
```


### Assessment Standards

```
# Compliance Standards
# Each regulatory compliance body has its own information security standards that organizations must adhere to maintain their accreditation. 
# The big compliance players in information security are PCI, HIPAA, FISMA, and ISO 27001.


- The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) 
is a commonly known standard in information security that implements requirements for organizations that handle credit cards. 
While not a government regulation, organizations that store, process, or transmit cardholder data must still implement PCI DSS guidelines. 

- HIPAA is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which is used to protect patients' data. 
HIPAA does not necessarily require vulnerability scans or assessments; 
however, a risk assessment and vulnerability identification are required to maintain HIPAA accreditation.

- The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) 
is a set of standards and guidelines used to safeguard government operations and information. 

- ISO 27001 is a standard used worldwide to manage information security. 
ISO 27001 requires organizations to perform quarterly external and internal scans.

# Penetration Testing Standards

# Penetration tests should not be performed without any rules or guidelines. 
# There must always be a specifically defined scope for a pentest, 
# and the owner of a network must have a signed legal contract with pentesters outlining what they're allowed to do and not.

# The Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) can be applied to all types of penetration tests:
- Pre-engagement Interactions
- Intelligence Gathering
- Threat Modeling
- Vulnerability Analysis
- Exploitation
- Post Exploitation
- Reporting

# OSSTMM is the Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual, 
# another set of guidelines pentesters can use to ensure they're doing their jobs properly. 
# It can be used alongside other pentest standards:
- Human Security (human beings are subject to social engineering exploits)
- Physical Security
- Wireless Communications (including but not limited to technologies like WiFi and Bluetooth)
- Telecommunications
- Data Networks


# The NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) is well known for their NIST Cybersecurity Framework, 
# a system for designing incident response # policies and procedures. NIST also has a Penetration Testing Framework. 
# The phases of the NIST framework include:
- Planning
- Discovery
- Attack
- Reporting

# OWASP stands for the Open Web Application Security Project. 
# They're typically the go-to organization for defining testing standards and classifying risks to web applications.
# OWASP maintains a few different standards and helpful guides for assessment various technologies:
- Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG)
- Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG)
- Firmware Security Testing Methodology
