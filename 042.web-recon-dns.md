### DNS ###

```
# The Domain Name System (DNS) acts as the internet's GPS, guiding your online journey from memorable landmarks (domain names) 
# to precise numerical coordinates (IP addresses).
# Much like how GPS translates a destination name into latitude and longitude for navigation, 
# DNS translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into the numerical IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1) that computers use to communicate.


### How DNS Works
# Your Computer Asks for Directions (DNS Query) ->
# The DNS Resolver Checks its Map (Recursive Lookup, if doesn't find in cache asking root Name Server by DNS hierarchy) ->
# Root Name Server Points the Way (Asking TLD Domain, "region" level) ->
# Top-Level Domain (TLD) Name Server Narrows It Down (Asking ANS, "location" level) -> 
# Authoritative Name Server Delivers the Address (to DNS resolver) -> 
# The DNS Resolver Returns the Information (to you localhost) ->
# Your Computer Connects: -> * 200 OK.

```

### Hosts files
```
# The hosts file is a simple text file used to map hostnames to IP addresses, 
# providing a manual method of domain name resolution that bypasses the DNS process.
# While DNS automates the translation of domain names to IP addresses, the hosts file allows for direct, local overrides. 
# This can be particularly useful for development, troubleshooting, or blocking websites.

# Location on Win:
C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
# On Linux, MacOS:
/etc/hosts

example:
<IP Address>    <Hostname> [<Alias> ...]
127.0.0.1       localhost
192.168.1.10    devserver.local

# redirecting a domain to a local server for development
127.0.0.1       myapp.local

# testing connectivity by specifying an IP address:
192.168.1.20    testserver.local

# or blocking unwanted websites by redirecting their domains to a non-existent IP address:
0.0.0.0       unwanted-site.com

```

### Key DNS Concepts

```
# In the Domain Name System (DNS), a zone is a distinct part of the domain namespace that a specific entity or administrator manages.
# Think of it as a virtual container for a set of domain names.
# For example, example.com and all its subdomains (like mail.example.com or blog.example.com) would typically belong to the same DNS zone.

# example of what a zone file, for example.com might look like:
$TTL 3600 ; Default Time-To-Live (1 hour)
@       IN SOA   ns1.example.com. admin.example.com. (
                2024060401 ; Serial number (YYYYMMDDNN)
                3600       ; Refresh interval
                900        ; Retry interval
                604800     ; Expire time
                86400 )    ; Minimum TTL

@       IN NS    ns1.example.com.
@       IN NS    ns2.example.com.
@       IN MX 10 mail.example.com.
www     IN A     192.0.2.1
mail    IN A     198.51.100.1
ftp     IN CNAME www.example.com.


# Most common DNS records concepts:
Domain Name	                  A human-readable label for a website or other internet resource.	www.example.com
IP Address	                  A unique numerical identifier assigned to each device connected to the internet.	192.0.2.1
DNS Resolver	              A server that translates domain names into IP addresses.	Your ISP's DNS server or public resolvers like Google DNS (8.8.8.8)
Root Name Server	          The top-level servers in the DNS hierarchy.	There are 13 root servers worldwide, named A-M: a.root-servers.net
TLD Name Server	              Servers responsible for specific top-level domains (e.g., .com, .org).	Verisign for .com, PIR for .org
Authoritative Name Server	  The server that holds the actual IP address for a domain.	Often managed by hosting providers or domain registrars.
DNS Record Types	          Different types of information stored in DNS.	A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, NS, TXT, etc.


# DNS records types:
Maps a hostname to its IPv4 address.
A	       Address Record	          www.example.com. IN A 192.0.2.1

	 
Maps a hostname to its IPv6 address.	 
AAAA	    IPv6 Address Record	      www.example.com. IN AAAA 2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334

 
Creates an alias for a hostname, pointing it to another hostname.
CNAME	    Canonical Name Record	  blog.example.com. IN CNAME webserver.example.net.

	  
Specifies the mail server(s) responsible for handling email for the domain.
MX	Mail   Exchange Record	          example.com. IN MX 10 mail.example.com.

	
Delegates a DNS zone to a specific authoritative name server.	
NS	Name   Server Record	          example.com. IN NS ns1.example.com.


Stores arbitrary text information, often used for domain verification or security policies.
TXT	    Text Record	                  example.com. IN TXT "v=spf1 mx -all" (SPF record)

	
Specifies administrative information about a DNS zone, including the primary name server, responsible person's email, and other parameters.
SOA	    Start of Authority Record	  example.com. IN SOA ns1.example.com. admin.example.com. 2024060301 10800 3600 604800 86400


Defines the hostname and port number for specific services.	
SRV	    Service Record	              _sip._udp.example.com. IN SRV 10 5 5060 sipserver.example.com.


Used for reverse DNS lookups, mapping an IP address to a hostname.
PTR	    Pointer Record	              1.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa. IN PTR www.example.com. 


# The "IN" in the examples stands for "Internet." It's a class field in DNS records that specifies the protocol family.
# Other class values exist (e.g., CH for Chaosnet, HS for Hesiod) but are rarely used in modern DNS configurations.
```

### Why DNS Matters for Web Recon

```
- Uncovering Assets: subdomains, mail servers, and name server records. e.g. a CNAME record pointing to an outdated server (dev.example.com CNAME oldserver.example.net) could lead to a vulnerable system.

- Mapping the Network Infrastructure: e.g. A record with Loadbalancer behind etc. 

- Monitoring for Changes: Reveal changes in the target's infrastructure over time. e.g. new subdomain is new endpoint to check with possible new info in TXT
```


### Digging DNS 

```
# DNS Tools

- dig	           Versatile DNS lookup tool that supports various query types (A, MX, NS, TXT, etc.) and detailed output.
- nslookup	       Simpler DNS lookup tool, primarily for A, AAAA, and MX records.
- host	           Streamlined DNS lookup tool with concise output.

```

# The Domain Information Groper

```
# Common dig Commands
dig domain.com	                Performs a default A record lookup for the domain.
dig domain.com A	            Retrieves the IPv4 address (A record) associated with the domain.
dig domain.com AAAA	            Retrieves the IPv6 address (AAAA record) associated with the domain.
dig domain.com MX	            Finds the mail servers (MX records) responsible for the domain.
dig domain.com NS	            Identifies the authoritative name servers for the domain.
dig domain.com TXT	            Retrieves any TXT records associated with the domain.
dig domain.com CNAME	        Retrieves the canonical name (CNAME) record for the domain.
dig domain.com SOA	            Retrieves the start of authority (SOA) record for the domain.
dig @1.1.1.1 domain.com	        Specifies a specific name server to query; in this case 1.1.1.1
dig +trace domain.com	        Shows the full path of DNS resolution.
dig -x 192.168.1.1	            Performs a reverse lookup on the IP address 192.168.1.1 to find the associated host name. You may need to specify a name server.
dig +short domain.com	        Provides a short, concise answer to the query.
dig +noall +answer domain.com	Displays only the answer section of the query output.
dig domain.com ANY	            Retrieves all available DNS records for the domain (Note: Many DNS servers ignore ANY queries to reduce load and prevent abuse, as per RFC 8482).


# Caution: Some servers can detect and block excessive DNS queries. Use caution and respect rate limits. 
# Always obtain permission before performing extensive DNS reconnaissance on a target. (?)

### Subdomains

```
# Why is this important for web reconnaissance?

- Development and Staging Environments: Companies often use subdomains to test new features or updates before deploying them to the main site.
Due to relaxed security measures, these environments sometimes contain vulnerabilities or expose sensitive information.

- Hidden Login Portals: Subdomains might host administrative panels or other login pages that are not meant to be publicly accessible.

- Legacy Applications: Older, forgotten web applications might reside on subdomains, potentially containing outdated software with known vulnerabilities.

- Sensitive Information: Subdomains can inadvertently expose confidential documents, internal data, or configuration files that could be valuable to attackers.

```

### Subdomain Enumeration

```
- Active Subdomain Enumeration:    DNS zone transfer, brute-force enumeration, dnsenum, ffuf, and gobuster

- Passive Subdomain Enumeration:   Certificate Transparency (CT) logs, search engines e.g. DuckDuckGo with site: operator etc.

# Each of these methods has its strengths and weaknesses. 
# Active enumeration offers more control and potential for comprehensive discovery but can be more detectable. 
# Passive enumeration is stealthier but might not uncover all existing subdomains. 

```

### Subdomain Bruteforcing

```
# Subdomain Brute-Force Enumeration is a powerful active subdomain discovery technique that leverages pre-defined lists of potential subdomain names.
# This approach systematically tests these names against the target domain to identify valid subdomains.
# By using carefully crafted wordlists, you can significantly increase the efficiency and effectiveness of your subdomain discovery efforts.

- Wordlist Selection: The process begins with selecting a wordlist containing potential subdomain names. 
- Iteration and Querying: A script or tool iterates through the wordlist, appending each word or phrase to the main domain
- DNS Lookup: A DNS query is performed for each potential subdomain to check if it resolves to an IP address.
- Filtering and Validation: If a subdomain resolves successfully, it's added to a list of valid subdomains.

# Further validation steps might be taken to confirm the subdomain's existence and functionality 
# (e.g., by attempting to access it through a web browser).
```

```
# There are several tools available that excel at brute-force enumeration:

dnsenum       Comprehensive DNS enumeration tool that supports dictionary and brute-force attacks for discovering subdomains.
fierce	      User-friendly tool for recursive subdomain discovery, featuring wildcard detection and an easy-to-use interface.
dnsrecon	  Versatile tool that combines multiple DNS reconnaissance techniques and offers customisable output formats.
amass	      Actively maintained tool focused on subdomain discovery, known for its integration with other tools and extensive data sources.
assetfinder	  Simple yet effective tool for finding subdomains using various techniques, ideal for quick and lightweight scans.
puredns	      Powerful and flexible DNS brute-forcing tool, capable of resolving and filtering results effectively.

done.

```

### DNS Zone Transfers

```
# While brute-forcing can be a fruitful approach, there's a less invasive 
# and potentially more efficient method for uncovering subdomains – DNS zone transfers.
# This mechanism, designed for replicating DNS records between name servers, 
# can inadvertently become a goldmine of information for prying eyes if misconfigured.

# A DNS zone transfer is essentially a wholesale copy of all DNS records within a zone (a domain and its subdomains) from one name server to another. 
# This process is essential for maintaining consistency and redundancy across DNS servers. 
# However, if not adequately secured, unauthorised parties can download the entire zone file, 
# revealing a complete list of subdomains, their associated IP addresses, and other sensitive DNS data.


# Zone Transerf mechanism concepts:
- Zone Transfer Request (AXFR): The secondary DNS server initiates the process by sending a zone transfer request to the primary server. This request typically uses the AXFR (Full Zone Transfer) type.

- SOA Record Transfer: Upon receiving the request (and potentially authenticating the secondary server), the primary server responds by sending its Start of Authority (SOA) record. The SOA record contains vital information about the zone, including its serial number, which helps the secondary server determine if its zone data is current.

- DNS Records Transmission: The primary server then transfers all the DNS records in the zone to the secondary server, one by one. This includes records like A, AAAA, MX, CNAME, NS, and others that define the domain's subdomains, mail servers, name servers, and other configurations.

- Zone Transfer Complete: Once all records have been transmitted, the primary server signals the end of the zone transfer. This notification informs the secondary server that it has received a complete copy of the zone data.

- Acknowledgement (ACK): The secondary server sends an acknowledgement message to the primary server, confirming the successful receipt and processing of the zone data. This completes the zone transfer process.

```

###  The Zone Transfer Vulnerability

```
# The information gleaned from an unauthorised zone transfer can be invaluable to an attacker. 
# It reveals a comprehensive map of the target's DNS infrastructure, including:

- Subdomains:          A complete list of subdomains, many of which might not be linked from the main website or easily discoverable through other means. 
These hidden subdomains could host development servers, staging environments, administrative panels, or other sensitive resources.
- IP Addresses:        The IP addresses associated with each subdomain, providing potential targets for further reconnaissance or attacks.
- Name Server Records: Details about the authoritative name servers for the domain, revealing the hosting provider and potential misconfigurations.


# Remediation
# Fortunately, awareness of this vulnerability has grown, and most DNS server administrators have mitigated the risk. 
# Modern DNS servers are typically configured to allow zone transfers only to trusted secondary servers, 
# ensuring that sensitive zone data remains confidential.
# However, misconfigurations can still occur due to human error or outdated practices.
```
