### Passwd, Shadow & Opasswd

[Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM)](https://web.archive.org/web/20220622215926/http://www.linux-pam.org/Linux-PAM-html/Linux-PAM_SAG.html)

```
# Linux-based distributions can use many different authentication mechanisms. 
# One of the most commonly used and standard mechanisms is Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM). 
# The modules used for this are called pam_unix.so or pam_unix2.so and are located in /usr/lib/x86_x64-linux-gnu/security/
# in Debian based distributions.

# For example, if we want to change the password of our account on the Linux system with passwd, 
# PAM is called, which takes the appropriate precautions and stores and handles the information accordingly.
```

```
# The pam_unix.so standard module for management uses standardized API calls 
# from the system libraries and files to update the account information. 
# The standard files that are read, managed, and updated are /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow. 
# PAM also has many other service modules, such as LDAP, mount, or Kerberos.
```

### Passwd File

```
# The /etc/passwd file contains information about every existing user on the system and can be read by all users and services. 
# Each entry in the /etc/passwd file identifies a user on the system. 
# Each entry has seven fields containing a form of a database with information about the particular user, 
# where a colon (:) separates the information.

# Passwd Format:
cry0l1t3    : x              :  1000   :  1000   :  cry0l1t3,,,        :  /home/cry0l1t3  :  /bin/bash
Login name    Password info     UID       GUID      Full name/comments    Home directory     Shell

# Modern systems have the hash values stored in the /etc/shadow file
# Usually, we find the value x in this field, which means that the passwords are stored in an encrypted form in the /etc/shadow file.
# Nevertheless, /etc/passwd is readable system-wide, giving attackers the possibility to crack the passwords if hashes are stored here.

# However, it can also be that the /etc/passwd file is writeable by mistake. 
# This would allow us to clear this field for the user root so that the password info field is empty. 
# This will cause the system not to send a password prompt when a user tries to log in as root.:

root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash         # Before, with pass for root user
root::0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash          # After (editing), without pass for root user
head -n 1 /etc/passwd                   # Check and Root without password
output:
root::0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
su
ouput:
[root@parrot]─[/home/cry0l1t3]#

# Even though the cases shown will rarely occur, we should still pay attention and watch for security gaps 
# because there are applications that require us to set specific permissions for entire folders. 
# If the administrator has little experience with Linux or the applications and their dependencies, 
# the administrator may give write permissions to the `/etc` directory and forget to correct them.
```

### Shadow File

```
sudo cat /etc/shadow                   # Check pass hashes in a shadow file
output:
...
root:*:18747:0:99999:7:::
sys:!:18747:0:99999:7:::
...

# If the password field contains a character, such as ! or *, the user cannot log in with a Unix password.
# The same case applies if the encrypted password field is empty. 
# This means that no password is required for the login.
# The encrypted password also has a particular format by which we can also find out some information:

$<type>$<salt>$<hashed>

# As we can see here, the encrypted passwords are divided into three parts. 
# The types of encryption allow us to distinguish between the following:

# Algorithm Types:
$1$ – MD5
$2a$ – Blowfish
$2y$ – Eksblowfish
$5$ – SHA-256
$6$ – SHA-512
```

### Opasswd

```
# The PAM library (pam_unix.so) can prevent reusing old passwords.
# The file where old passwords are stored is the /etc/security/opasswd. 
# Administrator/root permissions are also required to read the file 
# if the permissions for this file have not been changed manually.

sudo cat /etc/security/opasswd                       # Reading /etc/security/opasswd
output:   
cry0l1t3:1000:2:$1$HjFAfYTG$qNDkF0zJ3v8ylCOrKB0kt0,$1$kcUjWZJX$E9uMSmiQeRh4pAAgzuvkq1

# The MD5 ($1$) algorithm is much easier to crack than SHA-512. 
```

### Cracking Linux Credentials

```
# Once we have collected some hashes, we can try to crack them in different ways to get the passwords in cleartext.
# With tools below:

# Unshadow

sudo cp /etc/passwd /tmp/passwd.bak 
sudo cp /etc/shadow /tmp/shadow.bak 
unshadow /tmp/passwd.bak /tmp/shadow.bak > /tmp/unshadowed.hashes

# Hashcat - Cracking Unshadowed Hashes

hashcat -m 1800 -a 0 /tmp/unshadowed.hashes rockyou.txt -o /tmp/unshadowed.cracked   # Run tool against Unshadow generated file

# Hashcat - Cracking MD5 Hashes

cat md5-hashes.list        # Check example MD5 hashes
output:
qNDkF0zJ3v8ylCOrKB0kt0
E9uMSmiQeRh4pAAgzuvkq1

hashcat -m 500 -a 0 md5-hashes.list rockyou.txt       # Run hashcat against MD5 list with `rockyou` pass list
```

```

# Not worked for me hascat didn't find target pass by provided hash
# Despite the fact that the required password was in the list(!)

hashcat  -m 1800 -a 0 unshadowed.hashes ./mut_password.list                          # Cracking SHA-512 root hash

# Auto detect mode, clean up all other records in unshadowed.hashes
# --show flag. End getting pass in a seconds, strange behaviour of hashcat(?!)
