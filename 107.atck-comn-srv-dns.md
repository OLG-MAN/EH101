### Attacking DNS

```
# The Domain Name System (DNS) translates domain names (e.g., hackthebox.com) to 
# the numerical IP addresses (e.g., 104.17.42.72). 

# DNS is mostly UDP/53, but DNS will rely on TCP/53 more heavily as time progresses. 
# DNS has always been designed to use both UDP and TCP port 53 from the start, 
# with UDP being the default, and falls back to using TCP when it cannot communicate on UDP, 
# typically when the packet size is too large to push through in a single UDP packet. 
# Since nearly all network applications use DNS, attacks against DNS servers 
# represent one of the most prevalent and significant threats today.
```

### Enumeration

```
# DNS holds interesting information for an organization. 
# The Nmap -sC (default scripts) and -sV (version scan) options 
# can be used to perform initial enumeration against the target DNS servers:

nmap -p53 -Pn -sV -sC 10.10.110.213

...
PORT    STATE  SERVICE     VERSION
53/tcp  open   domain      ISC BIND 9.11.3-1ubuntu1.2 (Ubuntu Linux)
```

### DNS Zone Transfer

```
# A DNS zone is a portion of the DNS namespace that a specific organization or administrator manages. 
# Since DNS comprises multiple DNS zones, DNS servers utilize DNS zone transfers to copy a portion of their database
# to another DNS server. 
# Unless a DNS server is configured correctly (limiting which IPs can perform a DNS zone transfer), 
# anyone can ask a DNS server for a copy of its zone information since DNS zone transfers do not require any authentication.
```

### Domain Takeovers & Subdomain Enumeration

```
# Domain takeover is registering a non-existent domain name to gain control over another domain. 
# If attackers find an expired domain, they can claim that domain to perform further attacks such as 
# hosting malicious content on a website or sending a phishing email leveraging the claimed domain.
```

```
# Domain takeover is also possible with subdomains called subdomain takeover. 
# A DNS's canonical name (CNAME) record is used to map different domains to a parent domain. 
# Many organizations use third-party services like AWS, GitHub, Akamai, Fastly, 
# and other content delivery networks (CDNs) to host their content. 
# In this case, they usually create a subdomain and make it point to those services. 

# For example
sub.target.com.   60   IN   CNAME   anotherdomain.com
```

```
# The domain name (e.g., sub.target.com) uses a CNAME record to another domain (e.g., anotherdomain.com). 
# Suppose the anotherdomain.com expires and is available for anyone to claim the domain 
# since the target.com's DNS server has the CNAME record. 
# In that case, anyone who registers anotherdomain.com will have complete control over sub.target.com 
# until the DNS record is updated.
(clanky-wnaky info.. what big company will miss domain expiration??)
```

### Subdomain Enumeration

[subfinder](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder)

[dnsdumpster](https://dnsdumpster.com/)

[Sublist3r](https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r)

```
# Before performing a subdomain takeover, we should enumerate subdomains for a target domain using tools like Subfinder.
# This tool can scrape subdomains from open sources like DNSdumpster. 
# Other tools like Sublist3r can also be used to brute-force subdomains by supplying a pre-generated wordlist.

./subfinder -d inlanefreight.com -v       # Enumarate with subfinder
```

[subbrute](https://github.com/TheRook/subbrute)

```
# An excellent alternative is a tool called Subbrute. 
# This tool allows us to use self-defined resolvers and perform pure DNS brute-forcing attacks 
# during internal penetration tests on hosts that do not have Internet access.

git clone https://github.com/TheRook/subbrute.git >> /dev/null 2>&1
cd subbrute
echo "ns1.inlanefreight.com" > ./resolvers.txt
./subbrute inlanefreight.com -s ./names.txt -r ./resolvers.txt
```

```
# The tool has found four subdomains associated with inlanefreight.com. 
# Using the nslookup or host command, we can enumerate the CNAME records for those subdomains.

host support.inlanefreight.com

output:
support.inlanefreight.com is an alias for inlanefreight.s3.amazonaws.com
```

```
# The support subdomain has an alias record pointing to an AWS S3 bucket. 
# However, the URL https://support.inlanefreight.com shows a NoSuchBucket error 
# indicating that the subdomain is potentially vulnerable to a subdomain takeover. 
# Now, we can take over the subdomain by creating an AWS S3 bucket with the same subdomain name.
```

[can-i-take-over-xyz](https://github.com/EdOverflow/can-i-take-over-xyz)

```
# The can-i-take-over-xyz repository is also an excellent reference for a subdomain takeover vulnerability. 
# It shows whether the target services are vulnerable to a subdomain takeover 
# and provides guidelines on assessing the vulnerability.
```

### DNS Spoofing

```
# DNS spoofing is also referred to as DNS Cache Poisoning. 
# This attack involves altering legitimate DNS records with false information 
# so that they can be used to redirect online traffic to a fraudulent website. 
# Example attack paths for the DNS Cache Poisoning are as follows:

- An attacker could intercept the communication between a user and a DNS server 
  to route the user to a fraudulent destination instead of a legitimate one by performing a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack.

- Exploiting a vulnerability found in a DNS server could yield control over the server by attacker to modify the DNS records.
```

[bettercap](https://www.bettercap.org/)

```
# Local DNS Cache Poisoning

# From a local network perspective, attacker can also perform DNS Cache Poisoning using MITM tools like Ettercap or Bettercap.
# To exploit the DNS cache poisoning via Ettercap, 
# we should first edit the /etc/ettercap/etter.dns file to map the target domain name (e.g., inlanefreight.com) 
# that they want to spoof and the attacker's IP address (e.g., 192.168.225.110) that they want to redirect a user to:

cat /etc/ettercap/etter.dns

inlanefreight.com      A   192.168.225.110
*.inlanefreight.com    A   192.168.225.110
```

```
# Next, start the Ettercap tool and scan for live hosts within the network by navigating to 
# Hosts > Scan for Hosts. 
# Once completed, add the target IP address (e.g., 192.168.152.129) to Target1 
# and add a default gateway IP (e.g., 192.168.152.2) to Target2.
```

```
# Activate dns_spoof attack by navigating to Plugins > Manage Plugins. 
# This sends the target machine with fake DNS responses 
# that will resolve inlanefreight.com to IP address 192.168.225.110
```

```
# After a successful DNS spoof attack, if a victim user coming from the target machine 192.168.152.129 
# visits the inlanefreight.com domain on a web browser, 
# they will be redirected to a Fake page that is hosted on IP address 192.168.225.110
```

```
# In addition, a ping coming from the target IP address 192.168.152.129 
# to inlanefreight.com should be resolved to 192.168.225.110 as well:

C:\>ping inlanefreight.com

### Latest DNS Vulnerabilities

```
# We can find thousands of subdomains and domains on the web. 
# Often they point to no longer active third-party service providers such as AWS, GitHub, 
# and others and, at best, display an error message as confirmation of a deactivated third-party service.

# RedHuntLabs did a study on this in 2020, and they found that over 400,000 subdomains out of 220 million 
# were vulnerable to subdomain takeover. 62% of them belonged to the e-commerce sector.
```

```
# The Concept of the Attack

# One of the biggest dangers of a subdomain takeover is that a phishing campaign 
# can be launched that is considered part of the official domain of the target company. 
# For example, customers would look at the link and see that the domain customer-drive.inlanefreight.com 
# (which points to a nonexisting S3 bucket from AWS) is behind the official domain inlanefreight.com 
# and trust it as a customer. 

# However, the customers do not know that this page has been mirrored 
# or created by an attacker to provoke a login by the company's customers, for example.
```

```
# Subdomain takeover can be used not only for phishing but also for many other attacks. 
# These include, for example, stealing cookies, cross-site request forgery (CSRF), 
# abusing CORS, and defeating content security policy (CSP). 
# We can see some examples of subdomain takeovers on the HackerOne website, 
# which have earned the bug bounty hunters considerable payouts.
```
