### Payloads Deliver us Shells

```
# Within the IT industry as a whole, a payload can be defined in a few different ways:

- Networking: 
# The encapsulated data portion of a packet traversing modern computer networks.

- Basic Computing: 
# A payload is the portion of an instruction set that defines the action to be taken. 
# Headers and protocol information removed.

- Programming: 
# The data portion referenced or carried by the programming language instruction.

- Exploitation & Security: 
# A payload is code crafted with the intent to exploit a vulnerability on a computer system. 
# The term payload can describe various types of malware, including but not limited to ransomware.
```

```
# We view shells through the lens of the following perspectives throughout this module:


- Computing	
# The text-based userland environment that is utilized to administer tasks and submit instructions on a PC. Think Bash, Zsh, cmd, and PowerShell.

- Exploitation & Security	
# A shell is often the result of exploiting a vulnerability or bypassing security measures to gain interactive access to a host. 
# An example would be triggering EternalBlue on a Windows host to gain access to the cmd-prompt on a host remotely.

- Web:
# This is a bit different. A web shell is much like a standard shell, except it exploits a vulnerability (often the ability to upload a file or script) 
# that provides the attacker with a way to issue instructions, read and access files, 
# and potentially perform destructive actions to the underlying host. 
# Control of the web shell is often done by calling the script within a browser window.
```

### CAT5 Security's Engagement Preparation (Virtual case during this module)

```
# We are a penetration tester working for CAT5 Security, and we are preparing to perform an engagement for our client, Inlanefreight. 
# The more senior team members at CAT5 want to see our skills with shells & payloads before including us in the live engagement.

# The final assessment for this module is a series of challenges CAT5 Security created to test our skills. 
# Completing the challenge means you have passed the evaluation.

- Shell basics -

Bind Shell on Linux host.
Reverse Shell on Windows Host.

- Payload Basics -
Demonstrate launching a payload from MSF.
Demonstrate searching and building a payload from PoC on ExploitDB.
Demonstrate knowledge of payload creation.

- Getting a Shell on Windows - 
Using the recon results provided, craft or use a payload that will exploit the host and provide a shell back.

- Getting a Shell on Linux -
Using the recon results provided, craft or use a payload to exploit the host and establish a shell session.

- Landing a Web Shell -
Demonstrate knowledge of web shells and common web applications by identifying a common web application and its corresponding language.
Using the recon results provided, deploy a payload that will provide shell access from your browser.

- Spotting a Shell or Payload -
Detect the presence of a payload or interactive shell on a host by analyzing relevant information provided.

- Final Challenge -
Utilize knowledge gained from the previous sections to select, craft, and deploy a payload to access the provided hosts. 
Once a shell has been acquired, grab the requested information to answer the challenge questions.
