### Attacking Domain Trusts - Child -> Parent Trusts - from Linux

[well-known SIDs](https://adsecurity.org/?p=1001)



```
# We can also perform the attack shown in the previous section from a Linux attack host. 
# To do so, we'll still need to gather the same bits of information:

- The KRBTGT hash for the child domain
- The SID for the child domain
- The name of a target user in the child domain (does not need to exist!)
- The FQDN of the child domain
- The SID of the Enterprise Admins group of the root domain

# Performing DCSync with secretsdump.py

# Performing SID Brute Forcing using lookupsid.py

# Looking for the Domain SID

lookupsid.py logistics.inlanefreight.local/htb-student_adm@172.16.5.240 | grep "Domain SID"

# Grabbing the Domain SID & Attaching to Enterprise Admin's RID

lookupsid.py logistics.inlanefreight.local/htb-student_adm@172.16.5.5 | grep -B12 "Enterprise Admins"
```

```
# The same as before:

# We have gathered the following data points to construct the command for our attack. Once again, we will use the non-existent user hacker to forge our Golden Ticket.

- The KRBTGT hash for the child domain: 9d765b482771505cbe97411065964d5f
- The SID for the child domain: S-1-5-21-2806153819-209893948-922872689
- The name of a target user in the child domain (does not need to exist!): hacker
- The FQDN of the child domain: LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
- The SID of the Enterprise Admins group of the root domain: S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-519

# Next, we can use ticketer.py from the Impacket toolkit to construct a Golden Ticket. 
# This ticket will be valid to access resources in the child domain (specified by -domain-sid) and the parent domain (specified by -extra-sid).

# Setting the KRB5CCNAME Environment Variable

export KRB5CCNAME=hacker.ccache

# We can check if we can successfully authenticate to the parent domain's Domain Controller using Impacket's version of Psexec. 
# If successful, we will be dropped into a SYSTEM shell on the target Domain Controller.:

psexec.py LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/hacker@academy-ea-dc01.inlanefreight.local -k -no-pass -target-ip 172.16.5.5

[raiseChild.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/raiseChild.py)

```
# Impacket also has the tool raiseChild.py, which will automate escalating from child to parent domain. 
# We need to specify the target domain controller and credentials for an administrative user in the child domain; 
# the script will do the rest. 
# If we walk through the output, we see that it starts by listing out the child and parent domain's fully qualified domain names (FQDN).
# It then:

- Obtains the SID for the Enterprise Admins group of the parent domain
- Retrieves the hash for the KRBTGT account in the child domain
- Creates a Golden Ticket
- Logs into the parent domain
- Retrieves credentials for the Administrator account in the parent domain

# Finally, if the target-exec switch is specified, it authenticates to the parent domain's Domain Controller via Psexec.

# Note: the htb-student_adm account with password HTB_@cademy_stdnt_admin! is on the LOGISTICS domain controller, 
# which is a child domain of the INLANEFREIGHT domain.
