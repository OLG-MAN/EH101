### Getting Started with OpenVAS

```
# OpenVAS, by Greenbone Networks, is a publicly available vulnerability scanner. 
# Greenbone Networks has an entire Vulnerability Manager, part of which is the OpenVAS scanner. 
# Greenbone's Vulnerability Manager is also open to the public and free to use. 


# Install
sudo apt-get update && apt-get -y full-upgrade
sudo apt-get install gvm && openvas                # Not working on parrot OS, issues with gvm packages(some not present)

gvm-setup         # Setup OpenVAS
gvm-start         # Run
```

### OpenVAS Scan

```
# Multiple scan configurations leverage OpenVAS Network Vulnerability Test (NVT) Families, 
# which consist of many different categories of vulnerabilities, such as ones for Windows, Linux, Web Applications, etc. 
# You can see a few different types of families shown below:

- Base: 
This scan configuration is meant to enumerate information about the host's status and operating system information. 
This scan configuration does not check for vulnerabilities.

- Discovery: 
This scan configuration is meant to enumerate information about the system. 
The configuration identifies the host's services, hardware, accessible ports, and software being used on the system. 
This scan configuration also does not check for vulnerabilities.

- Host Discovery: 
This scan configuration solely tests whether the host is alive and determines what devices are active on the network. 
This scan configuration does not check for vulnerabilities as well. OpenVAS leverages ping to identify if the host is alive.

- System Discovery: 
This scan enumerates the target host further than the 'Discovery Scan' and attempts to identify the operating system and hardware associated with the host.

- Full and fast: 
This configuration is recommended by OpenVAS as the safest option and leverages intelligence 
to use the best NVT checks for the host(s) based on the accessible ports.

# Almost all options and scan structure similar to Nessus.
# So it's even much more faster to beigng aware with this scaner after Nessus.
