### Service Misconfigurations

```
# Main bad practices:

- Weak Auth password, default passwords
- Anonymous Authentication
- Misconfigured Access Rights with better options by links below:

```
# Unnecessary Defaults:

- Unnecessary features are enabled or installed (e.g., unnecessary ports, services, pages, accounts, or privileges).
- Default accounts and their passwords are still enabled and unchanged.
- Error handling reveals stack traces or other overly informative error messages to users.
- For upgraded systems, the latest security features are disabled or not configured securely.
```

### Preventing Misconfiguration

```
# Best Practices:
- Admin interfaces should be disabled.
- Debugging is turned off.
- Disable the use of default usernames and passwords.
- Set up the server to prevent unauthorized access, directory listing, and other issues.
- Run scans and audits regularly to help discover future misconfigurations or missing fixes.

```

### Finding Sensitive Information

```
# Sensitive information may include, but is not limited to:

- Usernames.
- Email Addresses.
- Passwords.
- DNS records.
- IP Addresses.
- Source code.
- Configuration files.
- PII.

# This module will cover some common services where we can find interesting information and discover different methods 
# and tools we can use to automate our discovery process. 
# These services include:

- File Shares.
- Email.
- Databases.

# There are two key elements to finding sensitive information:

- We need to understand the service and how it works.
- We need to know what we are looking for.
