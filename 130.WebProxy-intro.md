### Intro to Web Proxies

```
# Testing web requests to back-end servers make up the bulk of Web Application Penetration Testing, 
# which includes concepts that apply to both web and mobile applications. 
# To capture the requests and traffic passing between applications and back-end servers 
# and manipulate these types of requests for testing purposes, we need to use Web Proxies.

# Web proxies are specialized tools that can be set up between a browser/mobile application and 
# a back-end server to capture and view all the web requests being sent between both ends, 
# essentially acting as man-in-the-middle (MITM) tools.

# The following list shows some of the other tasks we may use web proxies for:

- Web application vulnerability scanning
- Web fuzzing
- Web crawling
- Web application mapping
- Web request analysis
- Web configuration testing
- Code reviews
```

### Burp Suite

```
# Burp Suite (Burp) - is the most common web proxy for web penetration testing. 
# It has an excellent user interface for its various features and even provides a built-in Chromium browser to test web applications. 
# Certain Burp features are only available in the commercial version Burp Pro/Enterprise, 
# but even the free version is an extremely powerful testing tool to keep in our arsenal.

# Some of the paid-only features are:

- Active web app scanner
- Fast Burp Intruder
- The ability to load certain Burp Extensions

# Most of the features we will cover in this module are available in the community free version of Burp Suite, 
# but we will also touch upon some of the pro features, like the Active Web App Scanner.

### OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)

```
# OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is another common web proxy tool for web penetration testing. 
# ZAP is a free and open-source project initiated by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) and maintained by the community, 
# so it has no paid-only features as Burp does. 

# The main advantage of ZAP over Burp is being a free, open-source project, 
# which means that we will not face any throttling or limitations in our scans that are only lifted with a paid subscription. 
```

### Proxy Setup (Burp, Zap)

```
# In Burp's (Proxy>Intercept), we can click on Open Browser, which will open Burp's pre-configured browser, 
# and automatically route all web traffic through Burp.
```

```
# In ZAP, we can click on the Firefox browser icon at the end of the top bar, and it will open the pre-configured browser.
```

```
# In many cases, we may want to use a real browser for pentesting, like Firefox. 
# To use Firefox with our web proxy tools, we must first configure it to use them as the proxy. 
# We can manually go to Firefox preferences and set up the proxy to use the web proxy listening port.

# Both Burp and ZAP use port 8080 by default, but we can use any available port. 
# If we choose a port that is in use, the proxy will fail to start, and we will receive an error message.
```

```
# Note: In case we wanted to serve the web proxy on a different port, we can do that in Burp under (Proxy>Options), 
# or in ZAP under (Tools>Options>Local Proxies). 
# In both cases, we must ensure that the proxy configured in Firefox uses the same port.
```

[Foxy Proxy](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-standard/)

```
# Instead of manually switching the proxy, we can utilize the Firefox extension Foxy Proxy 
# to easily and quickly change the Firefox proxy.

# Once we're on the options page, we can click on add on the left pane, 
# and then use 127.0.0.1 as the IP, and 8080 as the port, and name it Burp or ZAP.
```

### Installing CA Certificate

```
# Another important step when using Burp Proxy/ZAP with OUR browser is to install the web proxy's CA Certificates. 
# If we don't do this step, some HTTPS traffic may not get properly routed, 
# or we may need to click accept every time Firefox needs to send an HTTPS request.

# We can install Burp's certificate once we select Burp as our proxy in Foxy Proxy, 
# by browsing to http://burp, and download the certificate from there by clicking on CA Certificate.

# To get ZAP's certificate, we can go to (Tools>Network>Server Certificates), then click on Save.
# We can also change our certificate by generating a new one with the Generate button.
```

```
# Once we have our certificates, we can install them within Firefox by browsing to about:preferences#privacy, 
# scrolling to the bottom, and clicking View Certificates.

# After that, we can select the Authorities tab, and then click on import, and select the downloaded CA certificate.

# Finally, we must select Trust this CA to identify websites and Trust this CA to identify email users, and then click OK.

# Once we install the certificate and configure the Firefox proxy, 
# all Firefox web traffic will start routing through our web proxy.
```
