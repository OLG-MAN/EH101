### Additional AD Auditing Techniques

[AD Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/adexplorer)

```
# Creating an AD Snapshot with Active Directory Explorer

# AD Explorer is part of the Sysinternal Suite and is described as:

# "An advanced Active Directory (AD) viewer and editor. 
# You can use AD Explorer to navigate an AD database easily, define favorite locations, view object properties, 
# and attributes without opening dialog boxes, edit permissions, view an object's schema, 
# and execute sophisticated searches that you can save and re-execute."
```

[PingCastle](https://www.pingcastle.com/documentation/)

```
# PingCastle is a powerful tool that evaluates the security posture of an AD environment 
# and provides us the results in several different maps and graphs. 
# Thinking about security for a second, if you do not have an active inventory of the hosts in your enterprise, 
# PingCastle can be a great resource to help you gather one in a nice user-readable map of the domain.

# Viewing the PingCastle Help Menu

C:\htb> PingCastle.exe --help

# To run PingCastle, we can call the executable by typing PingCastle.exe into our CMD or PowerShell window 
# or by clicking on the executable, and it will drop us into interactive mode, 
# presenting us with a menu of options inside the Terminal User Interface (TUI).
```

[Group3r](https://github.com/Group3r/Group3r)

```
# Group3r is a tool purpose-built to find vulnerabilities in Active Directory associated Group Policy. 
# Group3r must be run from a domain-joined host with a domain user (it does not need to be an administrator), 
# or in the context of a domain user (i.e., using runas /netonly).

# Group3r Basic Usage

C:\htb> group3r.exe -f <filepath-name.log> 

# When running Group3r, we must specify the -s or the -f flag. 
# These will specify whether to send results to stdout (-s), or to the file we want to send the results to (-f). 
# For more options and usage information, utilize the -h flag, or check out the usage info at the link above.
```

[ADRecon](https://github.com/adrecon/ADRecon)

```
# Finally, there are several other tools out there that are useful for gathering a large amount of data from AD at once. 
# In an assessment where stealth is not required, it is also worth running a tool like ADRecon and analyzing the results, 
# just in case all of our enumeration missed something minor that may be useful to us or worth pointing out to our client.

# Running ADRecon

PS C:\htb> .\ADRecon.ps1

# Reporting

PS C:\htb> ls
```
