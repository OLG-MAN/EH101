### Targets

```
# Targets are unique operating system identifiers taken from the versions of those specific operating systems 
# which adapt the selected exploit module to run on that particular version of the operating system. 
# The show targets command issued within an exploit module view will display all available vulnerable targets for that specific exploit, 
# while issuing the same command in the root menu, outside of any selected exploit module, 
# will let us know that we need to select an exploit module first.



msf6 exploit(windows/browser/ie_execcommand_uaf) > info             # Check module info with list of targets inside

msf6 exploit(windows/browser/ie_execcommand_uaf) > set target 6      # Choose relevant target for exploit
output:
target => 6

# There is a large variety of target types. Every target can vary from another by service pack, OS version, and even language version. 
# It all depends on the return address and other parameters in the target or within the exploit module.

#  Comments in the exploit module's code can help us determine what the target is defined by.
# To identify a target correctly, we will need to:

- Obtain a copy of the target binaries
- Use msfpescan to locate a suitable return address
