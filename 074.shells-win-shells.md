```

### Enumerating Windows & Fingerprinting Methods

```
# Basic exmaple flow (something similar mentioned in other modules):

ping 192.168.86.39                                    # Knock-knock host
sudo nmap -v -O 192.168.86.39                         # Scan ports and OS, system info
sudo nmap -v 192.168.86.39 --script banner.nse        # Banner grab as additional scan-check
```

### Bats, DLLs, & MSI Files, Oh My!

```
# Payload Types to Consider

- DLL's:
# A Dynamic Linking Library (DLL) is a library file used in Microsoft operating systems to provide shared code and data that can be used 
# by many different programs at once. Injecting a malicious DLL or hijacking a vulnerable library on the host 
# can elevate our privileges to SYSTEM and/or bypass User Account Controls.

- Batch:
# Batch files are text-based DOS scripts utilized by system administrators to complete multiple tasks through the command-line interpreter. 
# These files end with an extension of .bat. 
# We can use batch files to run commands on the host in an automated fashion.

- VBS:
# VBScript is a lightweight scripting language based on Microsoft's Visual Basic. 
# It is typically used as a client-side scripting language in webservers to enable dynamic web pages.
# Attacks can be aimed at having users perform an action such as enabling the loading of Macros in an excel document 
# or clicking on a cell to have the Windows scripting engine execute a piece of code.

- MSI:
# .MSI files serve as an installation database for the Windows Installer. 
# When attempting to install a new application, the installer will look for the .msi file to understand all of the components required and how to find them. 
# We can use the Windows Installer by crafting a payload as an .msi file

- PowerShell:
# Powershell is both a shell environment and scripting language. 
# It serves as Microsoft's modern shell environment in their operating systems. 
# As a scripting language, it is a dynamic language based on the .NET Common Language Runtime that, 
# like its shell component, takes input and output as .NET objects.
```

### Tools, Tactics, and Procedures for Payload Generation, Transfer, and Execution

```
# Other Alternatives projects, tools, frameworks then Metasploit for Windows payloads:

- MSFVenom & Metasploit-Framework:
# MSF is an extremely versatile tool for any pentester's toolkit. 
# It serves as a way to enumerate hosts, generate payloads, utilize public and custom exploits, 
# and perform post-exploitation actions once on the host. 

- Payloads All The Things:
# Here, you can find many different resources and cheat sheets for payload generation and general methodology.

- Mythic C2 Framework:
# The Mythic C2 framework is an alternative option to Metasploit as a Command and Control Framework and toolbox for unique payload generation.

- Nishang:
# Nishang is a framework collection of Offensive PowerShell implants and scripts. It includes many utilities that can be useful to any pentester.

- Darkarmour:
# Darkarmour is a tool to generate and utilize obfuscated binaries for use against Windows hosts.

### Payload Transfer and Execution:

```
# Besides the vectors of web-drive-by, phishing emails, or dead drops, 
# Windows hosts can provide us with several other avenues of payload delivery. 
# The list below includes some helpful tools and protocols for use while attempting to drop a payload on a target.

- Impacket:
# Impacket is a toolset built-in Python that provides us a way to interact with network protocols directly. 
# Some of the most exciting tools we care about in Impacket deal with psexec, smbclient, wmi, Kerberos, and the ability to stand up an SMB server.

- Payloads All The Things: 
# Is a great resource to find quick oneliners to help transfer files across hosts expediently.

- SMB:
# SMB can provide an easy to exploit route to transfer files between hosts. 
# This can be especially useful when the victim hosts are domain joined and utilize shares to host data. 
# We can use these SMB file shares along with C$ and admin$ to host and transfer our payloads and even exfiltrate data over the links.

- Remote execution via MSF: 
# Built into many of the exploit modules in Metasploit is a function that will build, stage, and execute the payloads automatically.

- Other Protocols: 
# When looking at a host, protocols such as FTP, TFTP, HTTP/S, and more can provide you with a way to upload files to the host. 
# Enumerate and pay attention to the functions that are open and available for use.

### Example Compromise Walkthrough

```
# Enumerate The Host
# Ping, Netcat, Nmap scans, and even Metasploit are all good options to start enumerating our potential victims. 
# To start this time, we will utilize an Nmap scan.
```
`nmap -v -A 10.129.201.97`
```
# We figured out a few things during scanning & validation of the example host in question. 
# It is running Windows Server 2016 Standard 6.3.

# IIS could be a potential path, attempting to access the host over SMB utilizing a tool like Impacket 
# or authenticating if we had credentials could do it, 
# and from an OS perspective, there may be a route for an RCE as well. 
# MS17-010 (EternalBlue) has been known to affect hosts ranging from Windows 2008 to Server 2016. 

# Let's validate that using a builtin auxiliary check from Metasploit, auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010.

msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010) > use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010) > show options
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010) > set RHOSTS 10.129.201.97
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010) > run
output:
[+] 10.129.201.97:445     - Host is likely VULNERABLE to MS17-010! - Windows Server 2016 Standard 14393 x64 (64-bit)
[*] 10.129.201.97:445     - Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed

### CMD-Prompt and Power[Shell]s for Fun and Profit.

```
# Compare cmd and PowerShell for a minute to get a sense of what they offer and when it would be best to pick one over the other.

# CMD shell is the original MS-DOS shell built into Windows. 
# It was made for basic interaction and I.T. operations on a host. 
# Some simple automation could be achieved with batch files, but that was all.

# Powershell came along with a purpose to expand the capabilities of cmd. 
# PowerShell understands the native MS-DOS commands utilized in CMD and a whole new set of commands based in .NET. 
# New self-sufficient modules can also be implemented into PowerShell with cmdlets.

# CMD prompt deals with text input and output while Powershell utilizes .NET objects for all input and output. 
# Another important consideration is that CMD does not keep a record of the commands used during the session whereas, PowerShell does.
```

```
# Use CMD when:

- You are on an older host that may not include PowerShell.
- When you only require simple interactions/access to the host.
- When you plan to use simple batch files, net commands, or MS-DOS native tools.
- When you believe that execution policies may affect your ability to run scripts or other actions on the host.
```

```
# Use PowerShell when:

- You are planning to utilize cmdlets or other custom-built scripts.
- When you wish to interact with .NET objects instead of text output.
- When being stealthy is of lesser concern.
- If you are planning to interact with cloud-based services and hosts.
- If your scripts set and use Aliases.
```

### WSL and PowerShell For Linux

```
# The Windows Subsystem for Linux is a powerful new tool that has been introduced to Windows hosts 
# that provides a virtual Linux environment built into your host.

# Several examples of malware in the wild were attempting to utilize Python3 and Linux binaries to download 
# and install payloads onto a Windows host via WSL.

# One other thing to note is currently, any network requests or functions executed to or from the WSL instance 
# are not parsed by the Windows Firewall and Windows Defender, making it a bit of a blind spot on the host.

# The same issues can currently be found via PowerShell Core, which can be installed on Linux operating systems 
# and carry over many normal PowerShell functions. 
# These two concepts are exceptionally sneaky because, to date, 
# not much is known about the vectors of attack or ways to watch for them
