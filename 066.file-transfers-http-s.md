### Catching Files over HTTP/S

### HTTP/S

```
# Web transfer is the most common way most people transfer files because HTTP/HTTPS are the most common protocols allowed through firewalls. 
# Another immense benefit is that, in many cases, the file will be encrypted in transit.

# We have already discussed using the Python3 uploadserver module to set up a web server with upload capabilities, 
# but we can also use Apache or Nginx. 
```

### Nginx - Enabling PUT

```
# A good alternative for transferring files to Apache is Nginx because the configuration is less complicated, 
# and the module system does not lead to security issues as Apache can.

# When allowing HTTP uploads, it is critical to be 100% positive that users cannot upload web shells and execute them. 
# Apache makes it easy to shoot ourselves in the foot with this, as the PHP module loves to execute anything ending in PHP. 
# Configuring Nginx to use PHP is nowhere near as simple.

sudo mkdir -p /var/www/uploads/SecretUploadDirectory     # Create a Directory to Handle Uploaded Files

sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/uploads/SecretUploadDirectory        # Change the Owner to www-data

server {                                                 # Create Nginx Configuration File /etc/nginx/sites-available/upload.conf
    listen 9001;
    
    location /SecretUploadDirectory/ {
        root    /var/www/uploads;
        dav_methods PUT;
    }
}

sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/upload.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/    # Symlink our Site to the sites-enabled Directory

sudo systemctl restart nginx.service                     # Start Nginx

# Once we have this working, a good test is to ensure the directory listing is not enabled by navigating to http://localhost/SecretUploadDirectory. 
# By default, with Apache, if we hit a directory without an index file (index.html), it will list all the files. 
# This is bad for our use case of exfilling files because most files are sensitive by nature, and we want to do our best to hide them. 
# Thanks to Nginx being minimal, features like that are not enabled by default.
