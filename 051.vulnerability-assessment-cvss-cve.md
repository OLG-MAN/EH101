### Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

```
# The CVSS is often used together with the so-called Microsoft DREAD. 
# DREAD is a risk assessment system developed by Microsoft to help IT security professionals 
# evaluate the severity of security threats and vulnerabilities:
D amage Potential
R eproducibility
E xploitability
A ffected Users
D iscoverability


# Risk Scoring
# The CVSS scoring consists of the exploitability and impact of an issue. 
# The exploitability measurements consist of access vector, access complexity, and authentication. 
# The impact metrics consist of the CIA triad, including confidentiality, integrity, and availability.


```

### Base Metric Group

```
# The Exploitability metrics are a way to evaluate the technical means needed to exploit the issue using the metrics below:
- Attack Vector
- Attack Complexity
- Privileges Required
- User Interaction


# The Impact metrics represent the repercussions of successfully exploiting an issue and what is impacted in an environment, 
# and it is based on the CIA triad. 
# The CIA triad is an acronym for:
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability
```

### Temporal Metric Group

```
# Exploit Code Maturity
The Exploit Code Maturity metric represents the probability of an issue being exploited based on ease of exploitation techniques. There are various metric values associated with this metric, including Not Defined, High, Functional, Proof-of-Concept, and Unproven.

# Remediation Level
The Remediation level is used to identify the prioritization of a vulnerability. The metric values associated with this metric include Not Defined, Unavailable, Workaround, Temporary Fix, and Official Fix.

# Report Confidence
Report Confidence represents the validation of the vulnerability and how accurate the technical details of the issue are. The metric values associated with this metric include Not Defined, Confirmed, Reasonable, and Unknown.

```

### Calculating CVSS Severity
[Calculator](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator)
```
# The calculation of a CVSS v3.1 score takes into account all the metrics discussed in this section.
```

### CVSS Calculation Example
```
For example, for the Windows Print Spooler Remote Code Execution Vulnerability, CVSS Base Metrics is 8.8. 
You can reference the values of each metric value here.

### Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
```
# Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) is a publicly available information security international standard 
# used to evaluate and detail the system's current state and issues. 


# The four main classes of OVAL definitions consist of:
- OVAL Vulnerability Definitions: Identifies system vulnerabilities
- OVAL Compliance Definitions: Identifies if current system configurations meet system policy requirements
- OVAL Inventory Definitions: Evaluates a system to see if a specific software is present
- OVAL Patch Definitions: Identifies if a system has the appropriate patch

# Additionally, the OVAL ID Format consist of a unique format that consists of "oval:Organization Domain Name:ID Type:ID Value". 
# The ID Type can fall into various categories including: definition (def), object (obj), state (ste), and variable (var). 
# An example of a unique identifier would be oval:org.mitre.oval:obj:1116.


# Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) is a publicly available catalog of security issues sponsored by 
# the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS). 
# Each security issue has a unique CVE ID number assigned by the CVE Numbering Authority (CNA). 
```

### Stages of Obtaining a CVE
```
# Stage 1: Identify if CVE is Required and Relevant
# Stage 2: Reach Out to Affected Product Vendor
# Stage 3: Identify if Request Should Be For Vendor CNA or Third Party CNA
# Stage 4: Requesting CVE ID Through CVE Web Form
# Stage 5: Confirmation of CVE Form
# Stage 6: Receival of CVE ID
# Stage 7: Public Disclosure of CVE ID
# Stage 8: Announcing the CVE
# Stage 9: Providing Information to The CVE Team
```
