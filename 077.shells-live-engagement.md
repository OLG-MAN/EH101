### The Live Engagement

```
# Notes during shells asmt. 

# CAT5's team has secured a foothold into Inlanefrieght's network for us. 
# Our responsibility is to examine the results from the recon that was run, validate any info we deem necessary, 
# research what can be seen, and choose which exploit, payloads, and shells will be used to control the targets. 

# Objectives:
- Demonstrate your knowledge of exploiting and receiving an interactive shell from a Windows host or server.
- Demonstrate your knowledge of exploiting and receiving an interactive shell from a Linux host or server.
- Demonstrate your knowledge of exploiting and receiving an interactive shell from a Web application.
- Demonstrate your ability to identify the shell environment you have access to as a user on the victim host.
