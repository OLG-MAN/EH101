### Attacking Web Applications with Ffuf

```
# The following topics will be discussed:

- Fuzzing for directories
- Fuzzing for files and extensions
- Identifying hidden vhosts
- Fuzzing for PHP parameters
- Fuzzing for parameter values
```

### Wordlists

https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/

```
# Within our Parrot OS, we can find the entire SecLists repo available under /opt/useful/SecLists.

locate directory-list-2.3-small.txt                  # check where is the dir (SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/)

# Tip: 
# Taking a look at this wordlist we will notice that it contains copyright comments at the beginning, 
# which can be considered as part of the wordlist and clutter the results. 
# We can use the following in ffuf to get rid of these lines with the -ic flag.
```

### Ffuf

https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf.git

```
# Ffuf is pre-installed on your PwnBox instance. 
# If you want to use it on your own machine, you can either use "apt install ffuf -y" or download it and use it from its GitHub Repo. 
# As a new user of this tool, we will start by issuing the ffuf -h command to see how the tools can be used:

HTTP OPTIONS:
  -H               Header `"Name: Value"`, separated by colon. Multiple -H flags are accepted.
  -X               HTTP method to use (default: GET)
  -b               Cookie data `"NAME1=VALUE1; NAME2=VALUE2"` for copy as curl functionality.
  -d               POST data
  -recursion       Scan recursively. Only FUZZ keyword is supported, and URL (-u) has to end in it. (default: false)
  -recursion-depth Maximum recursion depth. (default: 0)
  -u               Target URL
...

```

### Directory Fuzzing

```
# The main two options are -w for wordlists and -u for the URL. 
# We can assign a wordlist to a keyword to refer to it where we want to fuzz. 
# For example, we can pick our wordlist and assign the keyword FUZZ to it by adding :FUZZ after it:

ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ

# Next, as we want to be fuzzing for web directories, 
# we can place the FUZZ keyword where the directory would be within our URL, with:

ffuf -w <SNIP> -u http://SERVER_IP:PORT/FUZZ

# Now, let's start our target in the question below and run our final command on it:

ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u http://SERVER_IP:PORT/FUZZ

# We see that ffuf tested for almost 90k URLs in less than 10 seconds. 
# This speed may vary depending on your internet speed and ping if you used ffuf on your machine, 
# but it should still be extremely fast.
```

### Task Solution

```

ffuf -ic -w ./SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u http://83.136.255.47:46505/FUZZ
```

### Page Fuzzing, Extension Fuzzing

```
# In the previous section, we found that we had access to /blog, but the directory returned an empty page, 
# and we cannot manually locate any links or pages. 
# So, we will once again utilize web fuzzing to see if the directory contains any hidden pages. 
# However, before we start, we must find out what types of pages the website uses, like .html, .aspx, .php, or something else.

# We can utilize the following wordlist in SecLists for extensions enum:

ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/web-extensions.txt:FUZZ -u http://SERVER_IP:PORT/blog/indexFUZZ

# And finally make Page fuzzing with target extension 

ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u http://SERVER_IP:PORT/blog/FUZZ.php
```

### Task Solution

```
ffuf -w ./SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/web-extensions.txt:FUZZ -u http://83.136.255.47:46505/blog/indexFUZZ

ffuf -ic -w ./SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u http://83.136.255.47:46505/blog/FUZZ.php
```

### Recursive Fuzzing

```
# In ffuf, we can enable recursive scanning with the -recursion flag, 
# and we can specify the depth with the -recursion-depth flag. 

# If we specify -recursion-depth 1, it will only fuzz the main directories and their direct sub-directories. 
# If any sub-sub-directories are identified (like /login/user, it will not fuzz them for pages). 
# When using recursion in ffuf, we can specify our extension with -e .php

# Finally, we will also add the flag -v to output the full URLs. 
# Otherwise, it may be difficult to tell which .php file lies under which directory.

# Note: we can still use `.php` as our page extension, as these extensions are usually site-wide.

# Finally, we will also add the flag -v to output the full URLs. 
# Otherwise, it may be difficult to tell which .php file lies under which directory.

ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ \
-u http://SERVER_IP:PORT/FUZZ -recursion -recursion-depth 1 -e .php -v
```

### Task solution

```
ffuf -ic -w ./SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ \
-u http://83.136.255.47:46505/FUZZ -recursion -recursion-depth 1 -e .php -v

# And wait a few minutes to enum flag.php file
```
