### Protected File Transfers

```
# As penetration testers, we often gain access to highly sensitive data such as user lists, credentials, 
# and enumeration data that can contain critical information about the organization's network infrastructure, 
# and Active Directory (AD) environment, etc. 

# Therefore, it is essential to encrypt this data or use encrypted data connections such as SSH, SFTP, and HTTPS. 
# However, sometimes these options are not available to us, and a different approach is required.
```

```
# Note: 
# Unless specifically requested by a client, we do not recommend exfiltrating data such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII), 
# financial data (i.e., credit card numbers), trade secrets, etc., from a client environment. 
# Instead, if attempting to test Data Loss Prevention (DLP) controls/egress filtering protections, 
# create a file with dummy data that mimics the data that the client is trying to protect.
```

### File Encryption on Windows

[Invoke-AESEncryption.ps1](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/DRTools/4.0.2.3/Content/Functions%5CInvoke-AESEncryption.ps1)

```
# Many different methods can be used to encrypt files and information on Windows systems. 
# One of the simplest methods is the Invoke-AESEncryption.ps1 PowerShell script. 
# This script is small and provides encryption of files and strings.

# We can use any previously shown file transfer methods to get this file onto a target host. 
# After the script has been transferred, it only needs to be imported as a module, as shown below.
```

```
# Import Module Invoke-AESEncryption.ps1
PS C:\file-transfer> Import-Module .\Invoke-AESEncryption.ps1      

# After the script is imported, it can encrypt strings or files, as shown in the following examples. 
# This command creates an encrypted file with the same name as the encrypted file but with the extension ".aes."

PS C:\file-trnsfer> Invoke-AESEncryption -Mode Encrypt -Key "p4ssw0rd" -Path .\scan-results.txt      # Encrypt file with AES
output:
File encrypted to C:\file-trnsfer\scan-results.txt.aes

# Using very strong and unique passwords for encryption for every company where a penetration test is performed is essential. 
```

### File Encryption on Linux

```
# To encrypt a file using openssl we can select different ciphers, see OpenSSL man page. 
# Let's use -aes256 as an example. We can also override the default iterations counts with the option -iter 100000 and 
# add the option -pbkdf2 to use the Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 algorithm. 
# When we hit enter, we'll need to provide a password. 

openssl enc -aes256 -iter 100000 -pbkdf2 -in /etc/passwd -out passwd.enc      # Encrypting /etc/passwd with openssl
output:
enter aes-256-cbc encryption password:                                                         
Verifying - enter aes-256-cbc encryption password:  

openssl enc -d -aes256 -iter 100000 -pbkdf2 -in passwd.enc -out passwd        # Decrypt passwd.enc with openssl
output:
enter aes-256-cbc decryption password: 
```
