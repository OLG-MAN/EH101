### John The Ripper

[John The Ripper](https://github.com/openwall/john)

```
# John the Ripper (JTR or john) is an essential pentesting tool used to check the strength of passwords 
# and crack encrypted (or hashed) passwords using either brute force or dictionary attacks. 
# It is open-source software initially developed for UNIX-based systems and first released in 1996. 
# It has become a staple of security professionals due to its various capabilities.

# With this, we can use various tools to convert different types of files and hashes into a format that is usable by John. 
# Additionally, the software is regularly updated to keep up with the current security trends and technologies, ensuring user security.

### Encryption Technologies

```
UNIX crypt(3)                         Crypt(3) is a traditional UNIX encryption system with a 56-bit key.
Traditional DES-based                 DES-based encryption uses the Data Encryption Standard algorithm to encrypt data.
bigcrypt                              Bigcrypt is an extension of traditional DES-based encryption. It uses a 128-bit key.
BSDI extended DES-based               BSDI extended DES-based encryption is an extension of the traditional DES-based encryption and uses a 168-bit key.
FreeBSD MD5-based (Linux & Cisco)     FreeBSD MD5-based encryption uses the MD5 algorithm to encrypt data with a 128-bit key.
OpenBSD Blowfish-based                OpenBSD Blowfish-based encryption uses the Blowfish algorithm to encrypt data with a 448-bit key.
Kerberos/AFS                          Kerberos and AFS are authentication systems that use encryption to ensure secure entity communication.
Windows LM                            Windows LM encryption uses the Data Encryption Standard algorithm to encrypt data with a 56-bit key.
DES-based tripcodes                   DES-based tripcodes are used to authenticate users based on the Data Encryption Standard algorithm.
SHA-crypt hashes                      SHA-crypt hashes are used to encrypt data with a 256-bit key and are available in newer versions of Fedora and Ubuntu.
SHA-crypt and SUNMD5 hashes (Solaris) SHA-crypt and SUNMD5 hashes use the SHA-crypt and MD5 algorithms to encrypt data with a 256-bit key.
...	and many more.

### Attack Methods

```
- Dictionary Attacks:
# Dictionary attacks involve using a pre-generated list of words and phrases (known as a dictionary) to attempt to crack a password. 
# This list of words and phrases is often acquired from various sources, such as publicly available dictionaries, 
# leaked passwords, or even purchased from specialized companies. 

- Brute Force Attacks:
# Brute force attacks involve attempting every conceivable combination of characters that could form a password. 
# This is an extremely slow process, and using this method is typically only advisable if there are no other alternatives.

- Rainbow Table Attacks:
# Rainbow table attacks involve using a pre-computed table of hashes and their corresponding plaintext passwords, 
# which is a much faster method than a brute-force attack. 
# However, this method is limited by the rainbow table size â€“ the larger the table, the more passwords, and hashes it can store.
# Additionally, due to the nature of the attack, it is impossible to use rainbow tables to determine the plaintext of hashes not already included in the table. # As a result, rainbow table attacks are only effective against hashes already present in the table, 
# making the larger the table, the more successful the attack.
```

### Cracking Modes

```
# Single Crack Mode

john --format=<hash_type> <hash or hash_file>      # command pattern
john --format=sha256 hashes_to_crack.txt           # specifies the hash SHA-256 format and file name containing the hashes
john --show                                        # check the progress 

# John will output the cracked passwords to the console and the file "john.pot" (~/.john/john.pot) to the current user's home directory.
```

### Wordlist Mode

```
# Wordlist Mode is used to crack passwords using multiple lists of words. 
# It is a dictionary attack which means it will try all the words in the lists one by one until it finds the right one.

john --wordlist=<wordlist_file> --rules <hash_file>
```

### Incremental Mode

```
# Incremental Mode is an advanced John mode used to crack passwords using a character set. 
# It is a hybrid attack, which means it will attempt to match the password by trying all possible combinations of characters from the character set. 
# This mode is the most effective yet most time-consuming of all the John modes. 

john --incremental <hash_file>
```

```
# The main difference between incremental mode and wordlist mode is the source of the password guesses. 
# Incremental mode generates the guesses on the fly, while wordlist mode uses a predefined list of words. 
# At the same time, the single crack mode is used to check a single password against a hash.
```

### Cracking Files

```
# It is also possible to crack even password-protected or encrypted files with John. 
# We use additional tools that process the given files and produce hashes that John can work with. 
# It automatically detects the formats and tries to crack them. 
# The syntax for this can look like this:

<tool> <file_to_crack> > file.hash
pdf2john server_doc.pdf > server_doc.hash
john server_doc.hash
# OR
john --wordlist=<wordlist.txt> server_doc.hash 
```

```
# Additionally, we can use different modes for this with our personal wordlists and rules. 
# We have created a list that includes many but not all tools that can be used for John:

pdf2john                 Converts PDF documents for John
