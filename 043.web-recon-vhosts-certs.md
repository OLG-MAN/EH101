### Virtual Hosts

```
# Once the DNS directs traffic to the correct server, the web server configuration becomes crucial in determining how the incoming requests are handled. 
# Web servers like Apache, Nginx, or IIS are designed to host multiple websites or applications on a single server. 
# They achieve this through virtual hosting, which allows them to differentiate between domains, 
# subdomains, or even separate websites with distinct content.

# How Virtual Hosts Work: Understanding VHosts and Subdomains
# At the core of virtual hosting is the ability of web servers to distinguish between multiple websites or applications sharing the same IP address.
# This is achieved by leveraging the HTTP Host header, a piece of information included in every HTTP request sent by a web browser.
# The key difference between VHosts and subdomains is their relationship to the Domain Name System (DNS) and the web server's configuration.

- Subdomains: These are extensions of a main domain name (e.g., blog.example.com is a subdomain of example.com). Subdomains typically have their own DNS records, pointing to either the same IP address as the main domain or a different one.

- Virtual Hosts (VHosts): Virtual hosts are configurations within a web server that allow multiple websites or applications to be hosted on a single server. 
Each virtual host can have its own separate configuration, enabling precise control over how requests are handled.


# Websites often have subdomains that are not public and won't appear in DNS records. 
# These subdomains are only accessible internally or through specific configurations. 
# VHost fuzzing is a technique to discover public and non-public subdomains and VHosts by testing various hostnames against a known IP address.
```

```
# Example of vHost conf file (name-based):
Code: apacheconf
# Example of name-based virtual host configuration in Apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName www.example1.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/example1
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName www.example2.org
    DocumentRoot /var/www/example2
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName www.another-example.net
    DocumentRoot /var/www/another-example
</VirtualHost>

# Here, `example1.com`, `example2.org`, and `another-example.net` are distinct domains hosted on the same server. 
# The web server uses the Host header to serve the appropriate content based on the requested domain name.
```

```
# Server VHost Lookup process in short:
- Browser Requests a Website -> 
- Host Header Reveals the Domain ->
- Web Server Determines the Virtual Host -> 
- Serving the Right Content -> * 200 OK
```

```
# Types of Virtual Hosting

- Name-Based Virtual Hosting 
- IP-Based Virtual Hosting
- Port-Based Virtual Hosting
```

### Virtual Host Discovery Tools

```
Name               Features
- gobuster		   Fast, supports multiple HTTP methods, can use custom wordlists.
- Feroxbuster      Supports recursion, wildcard discovery, and various filters.
- ffuf             Customizable wordlist input and filtering options.
```

### gobuster
```
gobuster vhost -u http://<target_IP_address> -w <wordlist_file> --append-domain       # command pattern to enun vhost subdomains

# options
-u     target URL
-w     wordlist
-t     number of threads (10 by default)
-k     ignore SSL/TLS certs error
-o     save outputi to file
--append-domain    append the base domain to each word in case vhosts (required in newer versions)


gobuster vhost -u http://inlanefreight.htb:81 -w ./subdomains-top1million-110000.txt --append-domain   # Scan subdomains on vhost with wordlist

### Certificate Transparency Logs

```
# In the sprawling mass of the internet, trust is a fragile commodity. 
# One of the cornerstones of this trust is the Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) protocol, 
# which encrypts communication between your browser and a website. 
# At the heart of SSL/TLS lies the digital certificate, a small file that verifies a website's identity and allows for secure, encrypted communication.


# However, the process of issuing and managing these certificates isn't foolproof. 
# Attackers can exploit rogue or mis-issued certificates to impersonate legitimate websites, intercept sensitive data, or spread malware. 
# This is where Certificate Transparency (CT) logs come into play.


# Certificate Transparency (CT) logs are public, append-only ledgers that record the issuance of SSL/TLS certificates. 
# Whenever a Certificate Authority (CA) issues a new certificate, it must submit it to multiple CT logs. 
# Independent organisations maintain these logs and are open for anyone to inspect.


# Think of CT logs as a global registry of certificates.
# This transparency serves several crucial purposes:

- Early Detection of Rogue Certificates: By monitoring CT logs, security researchers and website owners can quickly identify suspicious or misissued certificates.

- Accountability for Certificate Authorities: CT logs hold CAs accountable for their issuance practices.

- Strengthening the Web PKI (Public Key Infrastructure): The Web PKI is the trust system underpinning secure online communication.
```

### Searching CT Logs

```
# There are two popular options for searching CT logs:

- [crt.sh](https://crt.sh/)
User-friendly web interface, simple search by domain, displays certificate details, SAN entries.	
Quick and easy searches, identifying subdomains, checking certificate issuance history.	
Free, easy to use, no registration required.	
Limited filtering and analysis options.

- [Censys](https://search.censys.io/)
Powerful search engine for internet-connected devices, advanced filtering by domain, IP, certificate attributes.	
In-depth analysis of certificates, identifying misconfigurations, finding related certificates and hosts.	
Extensive data and filtering options, API access.	
Requires registration (free tier available).


# crt.sh example lookup (Web API);
curl -s "https://crt.sh/?q=facebook.com&output=json" | jq -r '.[] | select(.name_value | contains("dev")) | .name_value' | sort -u

output:
*.dev.facebook.com
*.newdev.facebook.com
*.secure.dev.facebook.com
dev.facebook.com
devvm1958.ftw3.facebook.com
...
