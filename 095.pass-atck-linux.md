### Linux Local Password Attacks

### Credential Hunting in Linux

```
# There are several sources that can provide us with credentials that we put in four categories. 
# These include, but are not limited to:

Files	         History                 Memory                   Key-Rings
Configs          Logs                    Cache                    Browser stored credentials
Databases        Command-line History    In-memory Processing	
Notes
Scripts
Source codes
Cronjobs	
SSH Keys

# Enumerating all these categories will allow us to increase the probability 
# of successfully finding out with some ease credentials of existing users on the system.
```

### Files

```
# One core principle of Linux is that everything is a file. 
# Therefore, it is crucial to keep this concept in mind and search, 
# find and filter the appropriate files according to our requirements. 
# We should look for, find, and inspect several categories of files one by one. 
# These categories are the following:

Configuration files      Databases        Notes
Scripts                  Cronjobs         SSH keys

# oneliner to grab all conf files paths on host to a list.txt

for l in $(echo ".conf .config .cnf");
do echo -e "\nFile extension: " $l; find / -name *$l 2>/dev/null | grep -v "lib\|fonts\|share\|core" >> list.txt;
done

# oneliner to grab all values with target words user, word, pass in .cngf files to list.txt

for i in $(find / -name *.conf 2>/dev/null | grep -v "doc\|lib");
do echo -e "\nFile: " $i; grep "user\|password\|pass" $i 2>/dev/null | grep -v "\#";
done
```

### Databases

```
# oneliner to grab DB sensitive values 
for l in $(echo ".sql .db .*db .db*");
do echo -e "\nDB File extension: " $l; find / -name *$l 2>/dev/null | grep -v "doc\|lib\|headers\|share\|man";
done
```

### Notes

```
find /home/* -type f -name "*.txt" -o ! -name "*.*"         # Find all possible txt Notes on host
```

### Scripts

```
# oneliner to find any scripts with target extansion 

for l in $(echo ".py .pyc .pl .go .jar .c .sh");
do echo -e "\nFile extension: " $l; find / -name *$l 2>/dev/null | grep -v "doc\|lib\|headers\|share";
done
```

### Cronjobs

```
# Cronjobs are independent execution of commands, programs, scripts. 
# These are divided into the system-wide area (/etc/crontab) and user-dependent executions. 
# Some applications and scripts require credentials to run and are therefore incorrectly entered in the cronjobs. 
# Furthermore, there are the areas that are divided into different time ranges 
# (/etc/cron.daily, /etc/cron.hourly, /etc/cron.monthly, /etc/cron.weekly). 
# The scripts and files used by cron can also be found in /etc/cron.d/ for Debian-based distributions.

cat /etc/crontab 
# /etc/crontab: system-wide crontab
# Unlike any other crontab you don't have to run the `crontab'
# command to install the new version when you edit this file
# and files in /etc/cron.d. These files also have username fields,
# that none of the other crontabs do.

SHELL=/bin/sh
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

# Example of job definition:
# .---------------- minute (0 - 59)
# |  .------------- hour (0 - 23)
# |  |  .---------- day of month (1 - 31)
# |  |  |  .------- month (1 - 12) OR jan,feb,mar,apr ...
# |  |  |  |  .---- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0 or 7) OR sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat
# |  |  |  |  |
# *  *  *  *  * user-name command to be executed
17 *    * * *   root    cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly


ls -la /etc/cron.*/     # Check cronjobs by related path
```

### SSH Private Keys

```
grep -rnw "PRIVATE KEY" /home/* 2>/dev/null | grep ":1"        # Grep and output path of potential private keys
``` 

### SSH Public Keys

```
grep -rnw "ssh-rsa" /home/* 2>/dev/null | grep ":1"            # Grep and output path of potential public keys
```

### History

```
tail -n5 /home/*/.bash*          # show last 5 rows of all bash itself related files
```

### Logs

```
# An essential concept of Linux systems is log files that are stored in text files. 
# Many programs, especially all services and the system itself, write such files. 
# In them, we find system errors, problems regarding services or follow what the system is doing in the background.
# Types of log files:

- Application Logs	
- Event Logs	
- Service Logs	
- System Logs

# Many different logs exist on the system. 
# These can vary depending on the applications installed, but here are some of the most important ones:

# Log File           Description
/var/log/messages    Generic system activity logs.
/var/log/syslog      Generic system activity logs.
/var/log/auth.log    (Debian) All authentication related logs.
/var/log/secure      (RedHat/CentOS) All authentication related logs.
/var/log/boot.log    Booting information.
/var/log/dmesg       Hardware and drivers related information and logs.
/var/log/kern.log    Kernel related warnings, errors and logs.
/var/log/faillog     Failed login attempts.
/var/log/cron        Information related to cron jobs.
/var/log/mail.log    All mail server related logs.
/var/log/httpd       All Apache related logs.
/var/log/mysqld.log  All MySQL server related logs.

# onliner to grep any value info from logs, based on trger word e.g. accpted, password changed etc.:

for i in $(ls /var/log/* 2>/dev/null);
do GREP=$(grep "accepted\|session opened\|session closed\|failure\|failed\|ssh\|password changed\|new user\|delete user\|sudo\|COMMAND\=\|logs" $i 2>/dev/null); if [[ $GREP ]];then echo -e "\n#### Log file: " $i; grep "accepted\|session opened\|session closed\|failure\|failed\|ssh\|password changed\|new user\|delete user\|sudo\|COMMAND\=\|logs" $i 2>/dev/null;fi;done
```

### Memory and Cache

[mimipenguin](https://github.com/huntergregal/mimipenguin)

```
# Many applications and processes work with credentials needed for authentication and store them either in memory 
# or in files so that they can be reused. For example, it may be the system-required credentials for the logged-in users.

# Memory - Mimipenguin

git clone https://github.com/huntergregal/mimipenguin && cd mimipeguin    # Install tool
sudo python3 mimipenguin.py                                               # Run tool to extract any creds from memore
```

```
# The passwords and hashes we can obtain come from the following sources but are not limited to:

Wifi            Wpa_supplicant  Libsecret       Kwallet
Chromium-based  CLI             Mozilla         Thunderbird
Git             Env_variable    Grub            Fstab
AWS             Filezilla       Gftp            SSH
Apache          Shadow          Docker          KeePass
Mimipy          Sessions        Keyrings

# For example, Keyrings are used for secure storage and management of passwords on Linux distributions. 
```

### Memory - LaZagne

[LaZagne](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne)

```
git clone https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne         # Clone tool
sudo python3 laZagne.py all                              # Run tool against linux system
```

### Browsers

[Firefox Decrypt](https://github.com/unode/firefox_decrypt)

```
# Browsers store the passwords saved by the user in an encrypted form locally on the system to be reused. 
# For example, the Mozilla Firefox browser stores the credentials encrypted in a hidden folder for the respective user.
# These often include the associated field names, URLs, and other valuable information.

# For example, when we store credentials for a web page in the Firefox browser, 
# they are encrypted and stored in logins.json on the system. 

# However, this does not mean that they are safe there. 
# Many employees store such login data in their browser without suspecting that it can easily be decrypted.

# Firefox Stored Credentials

ls -l .mozilla/firefox/ | grep default                                 # grep cred files
cat .mozilla/firefox/1bplpd86.default-release/logins.json | jq .       # check data and hashes in a target file

python3.9 firefox_decrypt.py                                           # Run tool to show decrypted passwords
```

### Browsers - LaZagne

```
python3 laZagne.py browsers                                            # Run tool to show decrypted passwords
