### MySQL ###

```
# The database system can quickly process large amounts of data with high performance. 
# The database is controlled using the SQL database language. 
# MySQL works according to the client-server principle and consists of a MySQL server and one or more MySQL clients. 
# MySQL is ideally suited for applications such as dynamic websites (LAMP, LEMP)

```

### Default Configuration
```
sudo apt install mysql-server -y
cat /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf | grep -v "#" | sed -r '/^\s*$/d'

[client]
port		= 3306
socket		= /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock

[mysqld_safe]
pid-file	= /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid
socket		= /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
nice		= 0

[mysqld]
skip-host-cache
skip-name-resolve
user		= mysql
pid-file	= /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid
socket		= /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
port		= 3306
basedir		= /usr
datadir		= /var/lib/mysql
tmpdir		= /tmp
lc-messages-dir	= /usr/share/mysql
explicit_defaults_for_timestamp

symbolic-links=0

!includedir /etc/mysql/conf.d/
```

### Dangerous Settings
```
user	            # Sets which user the MySQL service will run as.
password	        # Sets the password for the MySQL user.
admin_address	    # The IP address on which to listen for TCP/IP connections on the administrative network interface.
debug	            # This variable indicates the current debugging settings
sql_warnings	    # This variable controls whether single-row INSERT statements produce an information string if warnings occur.
secure_file_priv	# This variable is used to limit the effect of data import and export operations.
```

### Footprinting the Service
```
sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -sV -sC -p3306 --script mysql*     # Enumarate with nmap and mysql scripts
mysql -u root -h 10.129.14.132                             # "root user" check
output:

Your MySQL connection id is 150165
Server version: 8.0.27-0ubuntu0.20.04.1 (Ubuntu)          
```

### Basic commands
```
mysql -u <user> -p<password> -h <IP address>	# Connect to the MySQL server. There should not be a space between the '-p' flag, and the password.
show databases;	                                # Show all databases.
use <database>;	                                # Select one of the existing databases.
show tables;	                                # Show all available tables in the selected database.
show columns from <table>;	                    # Show all columns in the selected database.
select * from <table>;	                              # Show everything in the desired table.
select * from <table> where <column> = "<string>";	  # Search for needed string in the desired table.
select * from myTable WHERE name LIKE 'Otto%';        # grab info with part of name pattern
select email from myTable WHERE name LIKE 'Otto%';    # grab email results only from target part of name pattern
```


### MSSQL ###
```
# MSSQL is closed source and was initially written to run on Windows operating systems. 
# It is popular among database administrators and developers when building applications that run on Microsoft's .NET framework 
# due to its strong native support for .NET.
# MSSQL Clients - SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
# Other (not full list) - mssql-cli	, SQL Server PowerShell	, HeidiSQL	, SQLPro , Impacket's mssqlclient.py
# SSMS is a client-side application, it can be installed and used on any system
# This means we could come across a vulnerable system with SSMS with saved credentials that allow us to connect to the database. 


locate mssqlclient      # check py client for mssql

/usr/bin/impacket-mssqlclient
/usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/mssqlclient.py

```

### MSSQL Databases (by default)
```
master	    # Tracks all system information for an SQL server instance
model	    # Template database that acts as a structure for every new database created. 
msdb	    # The SQL Server Agent uses this database to schedule jobs & alerts
tempdb	    # Stores temporary objects
resource	# Read-only database containing system objects included with SQL server
```

### Default Configuration
```
# on GUI client:
server name
server type
auth:
    user
    pass
etc.
```

### Dangerous Settings
```
# In Summary:
- MSSQL clients not using encryption to connect to the MSSQL server
- The use of self-signed certificates when encryption is being used. It is possible to spoof self-signed certificates
- The use of named pipes
- Weak & default sa credentials. Admins may forget to disable this account
```

### Oracle TNS ###

```
# The Oracle Transparent Network Substrate (TNS) server is a communication protocol 
# that facilitates communication between Oracle databases and applications over networks.
# TNS support IPX/SPX and TCP/IP protocol stacks
# TNS has been updated to support newer technologies, including IPv6 and SSL/TLS encryption
# By default, Oracle TNS can be remotely managed in Oracle 8i/9i but not in Oracle 10g/11g.
# The TNS listener is configured to support various network protocols, including TCP/IP, UDP, IPX/SPX, and AppleTalk.
# The configuration files for Oracle TNS are called tnsnames.ora and listener.ora 
# and are typically located in the $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin directory. 

# Configuration:
# Each database or service has a unique entry in the tnsnames.ora file
tnsnames.ora (plain txt) :

ORCL =
  (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS_LIST =
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = 10.129.11.102)(PORT = 1521))
    )
    (CONNECT_DATA =
      (SERVER = DEDICATED)
      (SERVICE_NAME = orcl)
    )
  )


# On the other hand, the listener.ora file is a server-side configuration file that defines the listener process's properties and parameters
Listener.ora (plain txt):

```

### PL/SQL Exclusion List
```
# Oracle databases can be protected by using so-called PL/SQL Exclusion List (PlsqlExclusionList). 
# It is a user-created text file that needs to be placed in the $ORACLE_HOME/sqldeveloper directory, 
# and it contains the names of PL/SQL packages or types that should be excluded from execution.
# Once the PL/SQL Exclusion List file is created, it can be loaded into the database instance. 
# It serves as a blacklist that cannot be accessed through the Oracle Application Server.
